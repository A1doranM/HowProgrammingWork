    "Welcome back Agent. Often you will have to deal with PDF files. There are [many libraries in Python for working with PDFs](https://www.binpress.com/tutorial/manipulating-pdfs-with-python/167), each with their pros and cons, the most common one being **PyPDF2**. You can install it with (note the case-sensitivity, you need to make sure your capitilization matches):\n",
    "\n",
    "    pip install PyPDF2\n",
    "    \n",
    "Keep in mind that not every PDF file can be read with this library. PDFs that are too blurry, have a special encoding, encrypted, or maybe just created with a particular program that doesn't work well with PyPDF2 won't be able to be read. If you find yourself in this situation, try using the libraries linked above, but keep in mind, these may also not work. The reason for this is because of the many different parameters for a PDF and how non-standard the settings can be, text could be shown as an image instead of a utf-8 encoding. There are many parameters to consider in this aspect.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as PyPDF2 is concerned, it can only read the text from a PDF document, it won't be able to grab images or other media files from a PDF.\n",
