# Factory tasks

1. Take commented alternative implementation from `4-function.js` and rewrite it in TypeScript and pass `options` argument as union type with either `level` or `color`
2. Improve example `5-static.js`: use ECMA or CommonJS exports to export separately Class and factory function
3. Add `options` to `poolify` from `7-pool.js` to pass options to `factory` together with `poolSize` option
4. Pass configuration to `Creator` constructor from `8-method.js` example to affect all instances created by `factoryMethod`
