    "## Vector-Valued Functions: The \"What\" and \"Why\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're describing the path of a drone flying in three-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You could use parametric equations: `x = f(t)`, `y = g(t)`, and `z = h(t)`, where `t` (often time) is the parameter. This tells you the coordinates `(x, y, z)` of the drone at any time `t`.\n",
    "* A **vector-valued function** packages this information into a single vector that changes with `t`. At any given `t`, the function outputs a **position vector** `r(t)` whose tail is at the origin and whose head points to the drone's location `(x, y, z)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, a vector-valued function `r(t)` is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In 2D: `r(t) = <f(t), g(t)> = f(t)i + g(t)j`\n",
    "* In 3D: `r(t) = <f(t), g(t), h(t)> = f(t)i + g(t)j + h(t)k`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `f(t)`, `g(t)`, and `h(t)` are real-valued functions of the parameter `t`, called the **component functions**. The curve traced by the terminal point of the vector `r(t)` as `t` varies is called a **space curve** (in 3D) or a **plane curve** (in 2D).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use them?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Representing Curves in Space:** They are the standard way to describe curves in 3D (like helices, paths of satellites).\n",
    "2. **Motion in Physics:** If `t` represents time, `r(t)` gives the position of a particle. Its derivatives then give velocity and acceleration as vectors.\n",
    "3. **Direction and Orientation:** The parameter `t` naturally gives a direction or orientation to the curve.\n",
    "4. **Conciseness:** Vector notation is compact and powerful for describing geometric and physical quantities.\n",
    "5. **Calculus Operations:** Vector calculus (differentiation, integration) can be applied directly to `r(t)` to analyze the curve's properties (tangents, speed, acceleration, arc length).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining and Visualizing Vector-Valued Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Understanding the Components:**\n",
    "   You'll have a function `r(t)` defined by its component functions:\n",
    "   `r(t) = <x(t), y(t)>` or `r(t) = <x(t), y(t), z(t)>`\n",
    "   And often an interval for `t`, like `a ≤ t ≤ b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Visualizing the Curve:**\n",
    "   The curve is the set of all points `(x(t), y(t))` or `(x(t), y(t), z(t))` as `t` varies.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Step 1: Choose `t` values.** Select several values for `t` in its interval.\n",
    "* **Step 2: Calculate `r(t)`.** For each `t`, compute the vector `r(t)` (i.e., find `x(t), y(t), z(t)`).\n",
    "* **Step 3: Plot points.** Plot the terminal points of these vectors.\n",
    "* **Step 4: Connect points.** Connect the points in order of increasing `t` to visualize the curve and its orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1: A Parabola in 2D**\n",
    "   Define `r(t) = <t, t²>` for `-2 ≤ t ≤ 2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `x(t) = t`\n",
    "* `y(t) = t²`\n",
    "   If we eliminate `t`, we get `y = x²`, which is a parabola.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Table of points:**\n",
    "      | t  | x(t) = t | y(t) = t² | r(t)       | Point (x,y) |\n",
    "      |----|----------|-----------|------------|-------------|\n",
    "      | -2 | -2       | 4         | <-2, 4>    | (-2, 4)     |\n",
    "      | -1 | -1       | 1         | <-1, 1>    | (-1, 1)     |\n",

    "* `y(t) = sin(t)`\n",
    "* `z(t) = t`\n",
    "   The `x` and `y` components trace a circle in the `xy`-plane, while the `z` component increases linearly with `t`. This creates a spiral staircase shape, a helix.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calculus of Vector-Valued Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limits and Continuity\n",
    "\n",
    "The limit of a vector-valued function `r(t) = <f(t), g(t), h(t)>` as `t` approaches `a` is found by taking the limit of each component:\n",
    "`lim (t→a) r(t) = <lim (t→a) f(t), lim (t→a) g(t), lim (t→a) h(t)>`\n",
    "A vector-valued function `r(t)` is continuous at `t=a` if `lim (t→a) r(t) = r(a)`, which means all its component functions are continuous at `t=a`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Derivatives: `r'(t)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivative `r'(t)` (also written as `dr/dt`) of a vector-valued function `r(t)` is defined similarly to derivatives of real-valued functions:\n",
    "`r'(t) = lim (Δt→0) [r(t + Δt) - r(t)] / Δt`\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Calculate `r'(t)`:**\n",
    "You differentiate each component function separately:\n",
    "If `r(t) = <f(t), g(t), h(t)>`, then\n",
    "`r'(t) = <f'(t), g'(t), h'(t)>`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geometric Interpretation of `r'(t)`:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tangent Vector:** `r'(t)` is a vector that is **tangent** to the curve traced by `r(t)` at the point corresponding to `t`.\n",
    "* **Direction of Motion:** It points in the direction the curve is traced as `t` increases.\n",
    "* **Rate of Change:** If `r(t)` represents the position of a particle at time `t`, then `r'(t)` is the **velocity vector `v(t)`** of the particle.\n",
    "  * The direction of `v(t)` is the direction of motion.\n",
    "  * The magnitude of `v(t)`, `||v(t)|| = ||r'(t)||`, is the **speed** of the particle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1 (Parabola): `r(t) = <t, t²>`**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `x(t) = t`  => `x'(t) = 1`\n",
    "* `y(t) = t²` => `y'(t) = 2t`\n",
    "* So, `r'(t) = <1, 2t>`.\n",
    "   At `t=1`, the position is `r(1) = <1, 1>`. The tangent (velocity) vector is `r'(1) = <1, 2>`.\n",
    "   The speed at `t=1` is `||r'(1)|| = √(1² + 2²) = √5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2 (Helix): `r(t) = <cos(t), sin(t), t>`**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `x(t) = cos(t)` => `x'(t) = -sin(t)`\n",
    "* `y(t) = sin(t)` => `y'(t) = cos(t)`\n",
    "* `z(t) = t`      => `z'(t) = 1`\n",
    "* So, `r'(t) = <-sin(t), cos(t), 1>`.\n",
    "   At `t = π/2`, position `r(π/2) = <0, 1, π/2>`. Tangent vector `r'(π/2) = <-1, 0, 1>`.\n",
    "   Speed at `t = π/2` is `||r'(π/2)|| = √((-1)² + 0² + 1²) = √2`. Notice the speed is constant for this helix: `||r'(t)|| = √((-sin(t))² + (cos(t))² + 1²) = √(sin²(t) + cos²(t) + 1) = √(1 + 1) = √2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unit Tangent Vector `T(t)`:**\n",
    "The unit tangent vector gives only the direction of the tangent. It's found by dividing `r'(t)` by its magnitude (if `r'(t) ≠ 0`):\n",
    "`T(t) = r'(t) / ||r'(t)||`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tangent Line:**\n",
    "The tangent line to the curve at the point `P_0` corresponding to `r(t_0)` is the line passing through `P_0` in the direction of `r'(t_0)`. Its vector equation is:\n",
    "`L(s) = r(t_0) + s * r'(t_0)`\n",
    "where `s` is a parameter for the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Higher-Order Derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "You can differentiate `r'(t)` to get the second derivative `r''(t)`, and so on.\n",
    "`r''(t) = <f''(t), g''(t), h''(t)>`\n",
    "\n",
    "* If `r(t)` is position, then `r'(t) = v(t)` (velocity), and `r''(t) = a(t)` (acceleration).\n",
    "* The acceleration vector `a(t)` points towards the concave side of the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1 (Parabola): `r'(t) = <1, 2t>`**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `r''(t) = <d/dt(1), d/dt(2t)> = <0, 2>`.\n",
    "   The acceleration vector is constant, `a(t) = <0, 2>`, pointing upwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differentiation Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to scalar functions, with adjustments for vector operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `d/dt [r(t) + u(t)] = r'(t) + u'(t)` (Sum Rule)\n",
    "2. `d/dt [c * r(t)] = c * r'(t)` (Scalar Multiple, `c` is a scalar constant)\n",
    "3. `d/dt [s(t) * r(t)] = s'(t)r(t) + s(t)r'(t)` (Scalar Function Product, `s(t)` is a scalar function)\n",
    "4. `d/dt [r(t) ⋅ u(t)] = r'(t) ⋅ u(t) + r(t) ⋅ u'(t)` (Dot Product Rule)\n",
    "5. `d/dt [r(t) × u(t)] = r'(t) × u(t) + r(t) × u'(t)` (Cross Product Rule - order matters!)\n",
    "6. `d/dt [r(s(t))] = r'(s(t)) * s'(t)` (Chain Rule)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integrals of Vector-Valued Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "To integrate a vector-valued function, integrate each component:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Indefinite Integral:** `∫ r(t) dt = <∫f(t)dt, ∫g(t)dt, ∫h(t)dt> + C`\n",
    "    where `C = <C₁, C₂, C₃>` is a constant vector of integration.\n",
    "* **Definite Integral:** `∫[a,b] r(t) dt = <∫[a,b]f(t)dt, ∫[a,b]g(t)dt, ∫[a,b]h(t)dt>`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application:** If `v(t)` is the velocity vector, then the position vector `r(t)` can be found by integrating:\n",
    "`r(t) = ∫ v(t) dt`.\n",
    "If you know `a(t)` (acceleration), then `v(t) = ∫ a(t) dt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How They Work: A Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Defining a Path:** `r(t)` defines a curve in 2D or 3D space. As `t` changes, the head of the position vector `r(t)` traces out this path.\n",
    "2. **Instantaneous Change (Velocity):** `r'(t)` (the derivative) gives the instantaneous direction and rate of travel along this path. It's a vector tangent to the curve.\n",
    "    * Its direction is the \"way the curve is going\" at that point.\n",
    "    * Its magnitude is the \"speed\" at which the point is moving along the curve.\n",
    "3. **Rate of Change of Velocity (Acceleration):** `r''(t)` describes how the velocity vector is changing. It points towards the side the curve is bending.\n",
    "\n",
    "This framework is fundamental in physics (kinematics), computer graphics (defining paths for animation), and engineering (designing trajectories).\n",
