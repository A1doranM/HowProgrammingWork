    "### The Laplacian: Intuition and Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Intuition: The \"Average Curvature\"\n",
    "The most intuitive way to understand the Laplacian is by seeing it as the **divergence of the gradient**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Laplacian(f) = div(grad f) = ∇ ⋅ (∇f)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's translate this into a physical picture. Imagine a scalar function `f` represents the temperature on a metal plate.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Gradient `(∇f)`:** At any point, the gradient vector points in the direction of the steepest increase in temperature (the direction heat wants to flow *from*).\n",
    "2.  **Divergence `(∇ ⋅ ...)`:** The divergence of a vector field measures the net \"outflow\" from a point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, `div(grad f)` measures the net \"outflow of the steepest ascent vectors.\" What does this mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Consider a point at a local minimum** (the bottom of a bowl). From this point, all directions are \"uphill.\" The gradient vectors all point **away** from the minimum. There is a strong positive divergence of the gradient. The Laplacian is **positive**. This indicates the surface is \"curving up\" on average away from the point.\n",
    "*   **Consider a point at a local maximum** (the top of a hill). From this point, all directions are \"downhill.\" The gradient vectors all point **towards** the maximum (since `-∇f` points uphill). There is a strong negative divergence of the gradient. The Laplacian is **negative**. This indicates the surface is \"curving down\" on average away from the point.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Core Idea:** The Laplacian of a function `f` at a point is a **scalar** that measures how different the value of `f` at that point is from the **average** of its neighboring values. It essentially measures the function's \"bumpiness\" or average curvature. It is the multivariable generalization of the second derivative `f''(x)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`∇²f > 0`**: The point is \"colder\" than its average surroundings (like the bottom of a bowl). `f''(x) > 0` means concave up.\n",
    "*   **`∇²f < 0`**: The point is \"hotter\" than its average surroundings (like the top of a hill). `f''(x) < 0` means concave down.\n",
    "*   **`∇²f = 0`**: The point's value is exactly the average of its surroundings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Laplacian operator is denoted by **`∇²`** (del squared) or **`Δ`** (Delta).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Explicit Laplacian Formula and Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the \"how-to\" part, derived directly from the `∇ ⋅ (∇f)` definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The Gradient:** `∇f = < ∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y, ∂f/∂z >`\n",
    "*   **The Divergence of the Gradient:** We take the partial derivative of the first component with respect to `x`, the second with respect to `y`, etc., and add them up.\n",
    "    *   `∇ ⋅ (∇f) = ∂/∂x(∂f/∂x) + ∂/∂y(∂f/∂y) + ∂/∂z(∂f/∂z)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This simplifies to the standard formula for the Laplacian.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:** **`∇²f = (∂²f/∂x²) + (∂²f/∂y²) + (∂²f/∂z²)`**\n",
    "    *   This is the sum of all the \"pure\" second-order partial derivatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Finding the Laplacian: A Step-by-Step Computation Example\n",
    "Let's find the Laplacian of the function **`f(x, y) = x³ - 3xy²`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Find the first-order partial derivatives:**\n",
    "    *   `∂f/∂x = 3x² - 3y²`\n",
    "    *   `∂f/∂y = -6xy`\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Find the second-order partial derivatives:**\n",
    "    *   `∂²f/∂x²`: Differentiate `(3x² - 3y²)` with respect to `x` → `6x`\n",
    "    *   `∂²f/∂y²`: Differentiate `(-6xy)` with respect to `y` → `-6x`\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Sum them to get the Laplacian:**\n",
    "    *   `∇²f = (∂²f/∂x²) + (∂²f/∂y²) = 6x + (-6x) = 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:** The Laplacian of this function is zero everywhere. This means it has a very special property, which leads us to our next topic.\n",

    "### Harmonic Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "A function `f` is called **harmonic** if its Laplacian is zero everywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "**∇²f = 0**\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation is called **Laplace's Equation**, and it is one of the most important equations in all of physics and engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Physical Intuition:** A harmonic function represents a state of **equilibrium** or a **steady-state** condition. Since `∇²f = 0`, the value of the function at any point is exactly the average of the values of its neighbors. There are no local maxima or minima in the interior of the domain; all \"highs\" and \"lows\" must occur on the boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Rubber Sheet Analogy:** Imagine taking a wire frame of any shape, dipping it in soap solution, and pulling it out. The soap film that forms is a surface whose height `h(x, y)` is a harmonic function (`∇²h = 0`). The surface has no \"bumps\" or \"dips\" in the middle because the surface tension pulls everything into a state of minimal energy (equilibrium).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-Life Examples\n",
    "*   **Steady-State Heat Distribution:** The temperature in an object where the heat flow has stabilized is a harmonic function. The temperature at any point is the average of the temperatures around it.\n",
    "*   **Electrostatics:** The electric potential `V` in a region of space that contains no electric charge satisfies Laplace's equation (`∇²V = 0`).\n",
    "*   **Ideal Fluid Flow:** The velocity potential of an incompressible, irrotational fluid flow is harmonic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function from our previous example, `f(x, y) = x³ - 3xy²`, is harmonic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
