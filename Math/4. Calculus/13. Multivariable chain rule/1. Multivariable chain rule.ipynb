    "### The Multivariable Chain Rule (Component Form)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "Imagine a function `z = f(x, y)` that describes a surface, like the temperature on a metal plate. Now, imagine a particle is moving along that plate following a path defined by parametric equations: `x = x(t)` and `y = y(t)`, where `t` is time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The particle experiences a temperature that changes over time. We want to find the rate of change of the temperature with respect to time, `dz/dt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **multivariable chain rule** says that the total rate of change is the sum of the changes coming from each path of dependency.\n",
    "*   The temperature `z` changes as `x` changes (`∂z/∂x`), and `x` changes with time (`dx/dt`).\n",
    "*   The temperature `z` also changes as `y` changes (`∂z/∂y`), and `y` changes with time (`dy/dt`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The total rate of change `dz/dt` is the sum of these two effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:** **dz/dt = (∂z/∂x) * (dx/dt) + (∂z/∂y) * (dy/dt)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a \"tree diagram\" of the dependencies:\n",
    "*   `z` depends on `x` and `y`.\n",
    "*   `x` and `y` both depend on `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculation Example\n",
    "Let the temperature on a plate be given by `f(x, y) = x²y`. A particle moves along a circular path `x(t) = cos(t)` and `y(t) = sin(t)`. Find the rate of change of the temperature experienced by the particle at `t = π/4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Find all the component derivatives:**\n",
    "    *   `∂f/∂x = 2xy`\n",
    "    *   `∂f/∂y = x²`\n",
    "    *   `dx/dt = -sin(t)`\n",
    "    *   `dy/dt = cos(t)`\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Plug them into the chain rule formula:**\n",
    "    *   `dz/dt = (2xy) * (-sin(t)) + (x²) * (cos(t))`\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Substitute the path functions `x(t)` and `y(t)` into the formula to get everything in terms of `t`:**\n",
    "    *   `dz/dt = (2 * cos(t) * sin(t)) * (-sin(t)) + (cos(t)²) * (cos(t))`\n",
    "    *   `dz/dt = -2cos(t)sin²(t) + cos³(t)`\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Evaluate at `t = π/4`:**\n",
    "    *   At `t = π/4`, both `cos(t)` and `sin(t)` are `√2 / 2`.\n",
    "    *   `dz/dt = -2(√2/2)(√2/2)² + (√2/2)³`\n",
    "    *   `dz/dt = -2(√2/2)(2/4) + (2√2/8) = -2(√2/4) + (√2/4) = -√2/4`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:** At `t = π/4`, the temperature experienced by the particle is decreasing at a rate of `√2 / 4` degrees per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-Life Usage\n",
    "*   **Economics:** The profit `P` of a company might depend on production units `x` and advertising spend `y`. Both `x` and `y` might be changing over time `t` according to a business plan. The chain rule, `dP/dt`, calculates the overall rate of change of profit over time.\n",
    "*   **Aeronautics:** The atmospheric pressure `P` experienced by a rising weather balloon depends on its altitude `h` and horizontal position `(x, y)`. The balloon's position is a function of time `t`. The chain rule finds the rate of change of pressure measured by the balloon's sensors.\n",

    "### Vector Form of the Multivariable Chain Rule\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "The component form of the chain rule is correct but can be cumbersome. There is a much more elegant and compact way to write it using vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Look closely at the formula again: `dz/dt = (∂z/∂x)(dx/dt) + (∂z/∂y)(dy/dt)`.\n",
    "This looks exactly like a **dot product**!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define our vectors:\n",
    "*   The **gradient** of `f` is `∇f = < ∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y >`.\n",
    "*   The path is a vector-valued function `r(t) = < x(t), y(t) >`.\n",
    "*   The derivative of the path (the velocity vector) is `r'(t) = < dx/dt, dy/dt >`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the chain rule becomes the dot product of these two vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Vector Formula:** **dz/dt = ∇f(r(t)) ⋅ r'(t)**\n",
    "    *   This formula says the rate of change of the function along a path is the dot product of the gradient (evaluated *on the path*) and the path's velocity vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculation Example\n",
    "Let's use the same example: `f(x, y) = x²y` and `r(t) = <cos(t), sin(t)>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Find the gradient `∇f` and the velocity vector `r'(t)`:**\n",
    "    *   `∇f(x, y) = <2xy, x²>`\n",
    "    *   `r'(t) = <-sin(t), cos(t)>`\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Evaluate the gradient `∇f` along the path `r(t)`:**\n",
    "    *   Substitute `x=cos(t)` and `y=sin(t)` into `∇f`.\n",
    "    *   `∇f(r(t)) = < 2cos(t)sin(t), cos²(t) >`\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Calculate the dot product `∇f ⋅ r'(t)`:**\n",
    "    *   `dz/dt = < 2cos(t)sin(t), cos²(t) > ⋅ < -sin(t), cos(t) >`\n",
    "    *   `dz/dt = (2cos(t)sin(t)) * (-sin(t)) + (cos²(t)) * (cos(t))`\n",
    "    *   `dz/dt = -2cos(t)sin²(t) + cos³(t)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the exact same result we got with the component form, but the organization is cleaner. Evaluating at `t=π/4` gives the same answer: `-√2 / 4`.\n",

    "### Multivariable Chain Rule and Directional Derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "This is where the concepts truly unify. The **directional derivative** is just a special case of the multivariable chain rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the directional derivative `Dᵤf` tells us the rate of change of `f` at a point in the direction of a **unit vector `u`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "How can we represent \"moving in the direction of `u`\" as a path? We can define a straight-line path `r(t)` that starts at a point `P(x₀, y₀)` and moves with unit speed in the direction `u = <u₁, u₂>`.\n",
    "*   The path is `r(t) = <x₀ + t*u₁, y₀ + t*u₂>`.\n",
    "*   What is the velocity vector of this path? `r'(t) = <u₁, u₂> = u`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's apply the vector chain rule to find the rate of change of `f` along this path at our starting point (`t=0`):\n",
    "*   `df/dt = ∇f(r(0)) ⋅ r'(0)`\n",
    "*   `df/dt = ∇f(x₀, y₀) ⋅ u`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is precisely the formula for the directional derivative!\n",
    "**Dᵤf = ∇f ⋅ u**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Big Idea:** The chain rule is the more general concept. It calculates the rate of change of `f` along *any* curve (straight or not, constant speed or not). The directional derivative is the simplified result when that curve is a straight line with a constant speed of 1.\n",
