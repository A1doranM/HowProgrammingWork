    "### Divergence: Intuition, Formula, and Application\n",

    "### The Intuition: Sources and Sinks\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine your vector field `F` represents the flow of a fluid, like water. Now, place a tiny, imaginary, porous sphere at some point `(x, y, z)` in the fluid.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Divergence** measures the net rate of fluid flowing **out of** that infinitesimal sphere. It tells you if the point is a **source** or a **sink**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Positive Divergence (`div F > 0`):** More fluid is flowing out of the sphere than is flowing in. This point acts like a **source**. Think of a sprinkler head or a small spring at the bottom of a pool. The fluid is expanding or being created at this point.\n",
    "*   **Negative Divergence (`div F < 0`):** More fluid is flowing into the sphere than is flowing out. This point acts like a **sink**. Think of a drain in a bathtub. The fluid is compressing or being destroyed at this point.\n",
    "*   **Zero Divergence (`div F = 0`):** The amount of fluid flowing into the sphere exactly equals the amount flowing out. There is no net expansion or compression. The fluid is simply flowing through the region. Such a vector field is called **incompressible** or **divergence-free**. Think of a smoothly flowing river with no springs or drains.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Idea:** Divergence is a **scalar** quantity. At any given point, it's just a number, not a vector. It tells you \"how much\" the field is expanding or contracting, not \"in which direction.\"\n",

    "### The Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "The divergence is calculated using the partial derivatives of the component functions of the vector field. It is formally defined as the **dot product** of the **del (nabla) operator `∇`** and the vector field `F`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The **Del Operator `∇`** is a vector of partial derivative operators: `∇ = < ∂/∂x, ∂/∂y, ∂/∂z >`\n",
    "*   The **Vector Field `F`** has component functions: `F = < P(x,y,z), Q(x,y,z), R(x,y,z) >`\n",
    "\n",
    "When you \"dot\" them, you multiply corresponding components and add them up.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula in 3D:**\n",
    "    **div F = ∇ ⋅ F = (∂P/∂x) + (∂Q/∂y) + (∂R/∂z)**\n",
    "*   **Formula in 2D:**\n",
    "    **div F = ∇ ⋅ F = (∂P/∂x) + (∂Q/∂y)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to read the formula:**\n",
    "*   `∂P/∂x`: Measures how much the x-component of the field (`P`) changes as you move in the x-direction. It's a measure of horizontal \"stretch.\"\n",
    "*   `∂Q/∂y`: Measures how much the y-component of the field (`Q`) changes as you move in the y-direction. It's a measure of vertical \"stretch.\"\n",
    "*   `∂R/∂z`: Measures how much the z-component of the field (`R`) changes as you move in the z-direction. It's a measure of \"stretch\" in the z-direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The divergence is the sum of these \"stretches\" in all orthogonal directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step-by-Step Calculation Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's analyze the vector field **`F(x, y, z) = < x, y, z >`**. This field points directly away from the origin, and the vectors get longer the farther away they are. It represents a uniform explosion or expansion from the origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Identify the component functions P, Q, and R:**\n",
    "    *   `P(x, y, z) = x`\n",
    "    *   `Q(x, y, z) = y`\n",
    "    *   `R(x, y, z) = z`\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Calculate the necessary partial derivatives:**\n",
    "    *   `∂P/∂x = 1`\n",
    "    *   `∂Q/∂y = 1`\n",
    "    *   `∂R/∂z = 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Sum the partial derivatives to find the divergence:**\n",
    "    *   `div F = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:** The divergence is a constant positive number, 3. This means that *every point in this field* acts as a source of the same strength. The fluid is expanding everywhere at a constant rate. This matches our intuition of a uniform explosion.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-Life Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Electromagnetism (Gauss's Law):** This is one of the most profound applications. Gauss's Law states that the divergence of the electric field (`div E`) is proportional to the electric charge density (`ρ`).\n",
    "    *   `∇ ⋅ E = ρ / ε₀`\n",
    "    *   This means that positive electric charges are **sources** of the electric field (`div E > 0`), and negative charges are **sinks**. A region of empty space with no net charge is divergence-free (`div E = 0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Fluid Dynamics:** Engineers use divergence to model fluid flow. If `div(velocity field) = 0`, the fluid is incompressible (like water). If it's non-zero, the fluid is compressible (like a gas that is being heated and expanding).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Continuum Mechanics:** Divergence is used to describe the deformation of materials. A positive divergence of a displacement field indicates that a material is expanding under stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Code Illustration\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will use `sympy` to symbolically calculate the divergence for a few different vector fields, illustrating the concepts of sources, sinks, and incompressible fields.\n",
