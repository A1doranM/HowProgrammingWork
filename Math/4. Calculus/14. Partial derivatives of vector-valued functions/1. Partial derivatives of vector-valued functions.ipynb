    "### Computing the Partial Derivative of a Vector-Valued Function\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "This concept arises when you have a function that takes **multiple scalar inputs** but produces a **vector output**. Such a function defines a **parametric surface**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a flexible sheet or a sail in 3D space. The position of any point on that sheet can be described by two parameters, let's say `u` and `v`. `u` might represent how far you are along one edge, and `v` might be how far you are along an adjacent edge. The function `r(u, v)` gives you the `(x, y, z)` coordinate in space for any pair of `(u, v)` parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:** **r(u, v) = < x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v) >**\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the **partial derivative** of this vector-valued function with respect to one of its input parameters (e.g., `u`), you do exactly what you'd expect: **differentiate each component function with respect to that parameter, holding the other parameters constant**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Partial derivative with respect to `u`:**\n",
    "    **rᵤ = ∂r/∂u = < ∂x/∂u, ∂y/∂u, ∂z/∂u >**\n",
    "*   **Partial derivative with respect to `v`:**\n",
    "    **rᵥ = ∂r/∂v = < ∂x/∂v, ∂y/∂v, ∂z/∂v >**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Geometric Interpretation\n",
    "These partial derivative vectors, `rᵤ` and `rᵥ`, are **tangent vectors** to the parametric surface at the point `r(u, v)`.\n",
    "*   `rᵤ` points in the direction the surface is \"moving\" as you increase `u` while keeping `v` constant. It's tangent to a constant-`v` grid line.\n",
    "*   `rᵥ` points in the direction the surface is \"moving\" as you increase `v` while keeping `u` constant. It's tangent to a constant-`u` grid line.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two tangent vectors, `rᵤ` and `rᵥ`, define the **tangent plane** to the surface at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculation Example\n",
    "Let's describe a cylinder of radius 3 centered on the z-axis using parameters `u` (angle, like `θ`) and `v` (height, like `z`).\n",
    "*   `x(u, v) = 3cos(u)`\n",
    "*   `y(u, v) = 3sin(u)`\n",
    "*   `z(u, v) = v`\n",
    "*   **r(u, v) = < 3cos(u), 3sin(u), v >**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's find the tangent vectors at the point where `u = π/2` and `v = 4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Find the partial derivatives of the function `r(u, v)`:**\n",
    "    *   `rᵤ = ∂r/∂u = < -3sin(u), 3cos(u), 0 >`\n",
    "    *   `rᵥ = ∂r/∂v = < 0, 0, 1 >`\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Evaluate the partial derivatives at the specific point `(u=π/2, v=4)`:**\n",
    "    *   `rᵤ(π/2, 4) = < -3sin(π/2), 3cos(π/2), 0 > = < -3, 0, 0 >`\n",
    "    *   `rᵥ(π/2, 4) = < 0, 0, 1 >`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "*   First, find the actual point in space: `r(π/2, 4) = <0, 3, 4>`.\n",
    "*   At the point (0, 3, 4) on the cylinder:\n",
    "    *   The tangent vector `rᵤ` is `< -3, 0, 0 >`. This vector points straight in the negative x-direction, which is exactly tangent to the circular cross-section of the cylinder at that point.\n",
    "    *   The tangent vector `rᵥ` is `< 0, 0, 1 >`. This vector points straight up, parallel to the z-axis, which is tangent to the vertical lines of the cylinder.\n",

    "### Partial Derivative of a Parametric Surface\n",
    "\n",
    "This is just a different name for the same concept as above. When we say \"find the partial derivative of a parametric surface,\" we mean \"find the partial derivative of the vector-valued function that defines the surface.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The key takeaway is that these partial derivative vectors, `rᵤ` and `rᵥ`, are the building blocks for many important surface calculations:\n",
    "*   **Normal Vector:** The cross product `rᵤ × rᵥ` gives a vector that is **normal (perpendicular)** to the surface at that point. This is crucial for defining tangent planes and calculating surface integrals of vector fields (flux).\n",
    "*   **Surface Area:** The magnitude of this normal vector, `||rᵤ × rᵥ||`, represents the area of a tiny parallelogram on the surface. Integrating this quantity gives the total surface area.\n",

    "### Partial Derivatives of Vector Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "Now we switch contexts. A **vector field** is a function that takes a point in space as **input** (a vector) and produces another vector as **output**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the flow of wind: at every point `(x, y)` in the atmosphere, there is a wind vector `F(x, y)` describing its speed and direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:** A 2D vector field is written as:\n",
    "    **F(x, y) = < P(x, y), Q(x, y) >**\n",
    "    *   `P` and `Q` are regular scalar functions that give the components of the output vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, taking a partial derivative means finding how the *output vector* changes as one of the *input coordinates* changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Partial derivative with respect to `x`:**\n",
    "    **∂F/∂x = < ∂P/∂x, ∂Q/∂x >**\n",
    "*   **Partial derivative with respect to `y`:**\n",
    "    **∂F/∂y = < ∂P/∂y, ∂Q/∂y >**\n",
    "\n",
    "These derivatives are essential for calculating two fundamental properties of vector fields in calculus: **divergence** and **curl**.\n",
    "*   **Divergence (div F):** Measures how much the vector field is \"spreading out\" or \"expanding\" at a point. It's a scalar.\n",
    "    *   `div F = ∂P/∂x + ∂Q/∂y`\n",
    "*   **Curl (curl F):** Measures how much the vector field is \"circulating\" or \"rotating\" at a point. It's a scalar in 2D and a vector in 3D.\n",
    "    *   `curl F (scalar) = ∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculation Example\n",
    "Consider a vector field representing a whirlpool: `F(x, y) = < -y, x >`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Identify the component functions:**\n",
    "    *   `P(x, y) = -y`\n",
    "    *   `Q(x, y) = x`\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Find the four partial derivatives of these component functions:**\n",
    "    *   `∂P/∂x = 0`\n",
    "    *   `∂P/∂y = -1`\n",
    "    *   `∂Q/∂x = 1`\n",
    "    *   `∂Q/∂y = 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Assemble the partial derivatives of the vector field F:**\n",
    "    *   `∂F/∂x = < ∂P/∂x, ∂Q/∂x > = < 0, 1 >`\n",
    "    *   `∂F/∂y = < ∂P/∂y, ∂Q/∂y > = < -1, 0 >`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "*   `∂F/∂x = <0, 1>`: If you are at a point `(x, y)` and move a tiny step in the x-direction, the field vector `F` changes primarily in the y-direction (it tilts upwards).\n",
    "*   **Divergence:** `div F = ∂P/∂x + ∂Q/∂y = 0 + 0 = 0`. This means the fluid in this whirlpool is not being created or destroyed at any point; it's incompressible.\n",
    "*   **Curl:** `curl F = ∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y = 1 - (-1) = 2`. The positive, non-zero curl confirms that the field is rotating, which matches our intuition of a whirlpool.\n",
    "\n",

    "This code will use `sympy` to demonstrate the symbolic calculations for all three concepts.\n",
