    "Of course! Let's dive into **Double Integrals**. This is a natural and powerful extension of the single integrals you're used to.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Topic: Double Integrals\n",
    "\n",
    "Hello class! We've seen how a single integral `∫ f(x) dx` helps us find the area under a 2D curve. Now, we're going to step up a dimension. A double integral helps us find the **volume under a 3D surface**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Core Idea:**\n",
    "*   Imagine a surface defined by `z = f(x, y)`. This surface could be a mountain range, a dome, or a wavy sheet floating over the xy-plane.\n",
    "*   Imagine a rectangular region `R` on the floor (the xy-plane) directly beneath this surface.\n",
    "*   A double integral, `∬_R f(x, y) dA`, calculates the volume of the solid region between the floor `R` and the surface `f(x, y)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `dA` represents a tiny little patch of area in the region `R`. The double integral works by chopping the floor `R` into infinitely many tiny rectangles of area `dA`. For each patch, it calculates the volume of the tall, skinny column above it (which is `height × area = f(x, y) * dA`) and then adds up the volumes of all these columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculating Double Integrals (Fubini's Theorem)\n",
    "\n",
    "The magic of calculating a double integral is to turn it into two single integrals, one inside the other. This is called an **iterated integral**. We can do this in two orders:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `∬_R f(x, y) dA = ∫_a^b [ ∫_c^d f(x, y) dy ] dx`\n",
    "2.  `∬_R f(x, y) dA = ∫_c^d [ ∫_a^b f(x, y) dx ] dy`\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to read this:**\n",
    "*   **Work from the inside out.** For the first order (`dy dx`), you first integrate `f(x, y)` with respect to `y`, treating `x` as if it were just a constant.\n",
    "*   Then, you plug in the `y`-bounds (`c` and `d`).\n",
    "*   The result will be an expression that only has `x` in it. You then integrate this new expression with respect to `x` using the `x`-bounds (`a` and `b`).\n",

    "### Detailed Calculation Example: Rectangular Region\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's find the volume under the surface **`f(x, y) = x² + y`** over the rectangular region `R` defined by **`0 ≤ x ≤ 2`** and **`0 ≤ y ≤ 1`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Set up the Iterated Integral**\n",
    "Let's use the `dy dx` order. The outer bounds are for `x` (0 to 2), and the inner bounds are for `y` (0 to 1).\n",
    "`Volume = ∫_0^2 ∫_0^1 (x² + y) dy dx`\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Solve the Inner Integral**\n",
    "We integrate `(x² + y)` with respect to `y`, treating `x²` as a constant.\n",
    "`∫_0^1 (x² + y) dy = [ x²y + y²/2 ]` evaluated from `y=0` to `y=1`.\n",
    "Plug in the `y` bounds:\n",
    "`= [ x²(1) + 1²/2 ] - [ x²(0) + 0²/2 ]`\n",
    "`= [ x² + 1/2 ] - [ 0 ] = x² + 1/2`\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Solve the Outer Integral**\n",
    "Now we take the result from Step 2 and integrate it with respect to `x`.\n",
    "`∫_0^2 (x² + 1/2) dx = [ x³/3 + x/2 ]` evaluated from `x=0` to `x=2`.\n",
    "Plug in the `x` bounds:\n",
    "`= [ 2³/3 + 2/2 ] - [ 0³/3 + 0/2 ]`\n",
    "`= [ 8/3 + 1 ] - [ 0 ] = 8/3 + 3/3 = 11/3`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Result:** The volume is **11/3** cubic units.\n",

    "### Finding Bounds and Double Integrals with Variable Bounds\n",
    "\n",
    "Most regions aren't simple rectangles. They are triangles, circles, or other curvy shapes. In these cases, the inner bounds of integration will be functions, not constants.\n",

    "*   **For `dy dx` order (Vertical Slices):**\n",
    "    1.  Imagine the \"shadow\" of the region cast onto the **x-axis**. This gives you the outer, constant bounds for `x`, from `x=a` to `x=b`.\n",
    "    2.  Now, imagine a vertical arrow shooting up through the region at some `x` value. The `y`-value where the arrow **enters** the region is the lower bound, `y = g₁(x)`. The `y`-value where it **exits** is the upper bound, `y = g₂(x)`.\n",

    "*   **Inner (x):** A horizontal arrow enters the region at the diagonal line. We must rewrite this line as `x` in terms of `y`: `y = x/2` becomes `x = 2y`. The arrow exits at the vertical line, `x = 2`. So, `2y ≤ x ≤ 2`.\n",
