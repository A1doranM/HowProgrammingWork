    "### Constrained Optimization: An Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are a hiker on a mountain. Your goal is to reach the highest point possible.\n",
    "*   **Unconstrained Optimization:** This is what we discussed before. You can roam freely anywhere on the entire mountain range to find the absolute highest peak.\n",
    "*   **Constrained Optimization:** Now, imagine you must stay on a specific, winding trail. Your goal is still to reach the highest point, but *only considering the points on that trail*. The trail is your **constraint**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The highest point on the trail is likely not the absolute highest peak of the mountain, but it's the best you can do given your limitation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematics, we have a similar situation. We want to maximize or minimize a function `f(x, y)` (the height of the mountain), subject to a constraint `g(x, y) = c` (the path of the trail).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Example:** A company wants to maximize its production output (`f`). Its output depends on two inputs: labor hours (`x`) and machine time (`y`). However, the company has a limited budget (`c`). The cost of labor and machine time forms the constraint (`g`). The company needs to find the combination of labor and machine time that maximizes production *without exceeding the budget*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lagrange Multipliers: Using Tangency to Solve the Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do we find this optimal point on the trail?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's think about the mountain again. Imagine the mountain has contour lines (level curves), where each line represents a specific elevation. To climb higher, you have to move from one contour line to a higher one.\n",
    "\n",
    "You walk along your trail (the constraint). As long as the trail crosses a contour line, you are either moving up or down. You can still get higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will reach the highest point on the trail at the exact spot where the trail **just touches** one of the contour lines without crossing it. At this point, the trail and the contour line are **tangent** to each other. If you were to move even a tiny bit further along the trail, you'd start going downhill again.\n",
    "\n",
    "This geometric idea has a powerful mathematical equivalent using **gradients**. The gradient of a function (`∇f`) is a vector that points in the direction of the steepest ascent (straight up the mountain). The gradient is always perpendicular to the level curve at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The gradient of our function `f(x, y)` is `∇f = (∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y)`.\n",
    "*   The gradient of our constraint `g(x, y)` is `∇g = (∂g/∂x, ∂g/∂y)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the level curve of `f` and the constraint curve `g` to be tangent, their perpendicular vectors (their gradients) must point in the same (or exactly opposite) direction. This means one gradient vector must be a scalar multiple of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "We call this scalar `λ` (lambda), the **Lagrange multiplier**. This gives us the central equation for Lagrange multipliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "**∇f(x, y) = λ * ∇g(x, y)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Lagrangian Function\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"tangency\" equation above is a brilliant insight, but solving it along with the constraint `g(x, y) = c` can be cumbersome. To simplify this, we introduce a new function called the **Lagrangian (L)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lagrangian combines our function, our constraint, and the multiplier `λ` into a single function:\n",
    "\n",
    "**L(x, y, λ) = f(x, y) - λ(g(x, y) - c)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, watch what happens when we treat this as a standard *unconstrained* optimization problem. To find the critical points of `L`, we take the partial derivatives with respect to all its variables (`x`, `y`, and `λ`) and set them to zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `∂L/∂x = ∂f/∂x - λ(∂g/∂x) = 0`  =>  `∂f/∂x = λ(∂g/∂x)`\n",
    "2.  `∂L/∂y = ∂f/∂y - λ(∂g/∂y) = 0`  =>  `∂f/∂y = λ(∂g/∂y)`\n",
    "3.  `∂L/∂λ = -(g(x, y) - c) = 0`      =>  `g(x, y) = c`\n",
    "\n",
    "Look closely! The first two equations are exactly the `∇f = λ∇g` condition. The third equation is our original constraint! By finding the critical points of the Lagrangian, we are elegantly solving the entire constrained optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Meaning of the Lagrange Multiplier (λ)\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiplier `λ` isn't just a mathematical trick; it has a profound and useful economic interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`λ` tells you how much the optimal value of `f` will change if you slightly relax the constraint `c`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go back to our business example:\n",
    "*   `f` is the maximum production output.\n",
    "*   `c` is the budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we solve the problem and find that `λ = 150`, it means that if we increase the budget `c` by **$1**, our maximum possible production `f` will increase by approximately **150 units**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This value `λ` is often called the **shadow price** or marginal utility of the constraint. It tells you exactly how much \"bang for your buck\" you'd get from increasing your budget. If the extra 150 units of production are worth more than the $1 it cost to relax the budget, you should do it!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuitive Proof for the Meaning of λ\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's quickly prove this interpretation. Let `f*(c)` be the optimal value of our function for a given constraint `c`. This optimal value is found at a point `(x(c), y(c))`. We want to find `df*/dc`, the rate of change of the optimal value with respect to the constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the multivariable chain rule:\n",
    "`df*/dc = (∂f/∂x)(dx/dc) + (∂f/∂y)(dy/dc)`\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Lagrangian conditions, we know `∂f/∂x = λ(∂g/∂x)` and `∂f/∂y = λ(∂g/∂y)`. Let's substitute these in:\n",
    "`df*/dc = λ(∂g/∂x)(dx/dc) + λ(∂g/∂y)(dy/dc)`\n",
    "`df*/dc = λ * [ (∂g/∂x)(dx/dc) + (∂g/∂y)(dy/dc) ]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The term in the brackets is just the chain rule for `dg/dc`.\n",
    "So, `df*/dc = λ * (dg/dc)`\n",
    "\n",
    "We also know that our solution point `(x(c), y(c))` must always satisfy the constraint `g(x(c), y(c)) = c`. If we differentiate this whole equation with respect to `c`, we get:\n",
    "`dg/dc = 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting this back into our equation for `df*/dc`, we get:\n",
    "`df*/dc = λ * 1`\n",
    "**`df*/dc = λ`**\n",
    "\n",
    "This proves it! The Lagrange multiplier `λ` is indeed the instantaneous rate of change of the optimal value of `f` with respect to the constraint `c`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Code Illustration\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's solve a classic problem: Find the dimensions of a rectangle with the largest possible area, given a fixed perimeter of 20 units.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Function to maximize:** Area `f(x, y) = x * y`\n",
    "*   **Constraint:** Perimeter `g(x, y) = 2x + 2y = 20`\n",
