    "#### Green's Theorem - The Concept Revisited\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have a flat 2D region `D` (like a pond) whose boundary is a single closed curve `C` (the shoreline). Let's also say there's a vector field `F = <P, Q>` defined everywhere on this region (like the water current in the pond).\n",
    "\n",
    "Green's Theorem provides two ways of calculating the fluid's circulation around the boundary:\n",
    "\n",
    "**∮_C (P dx + Q dy) = ∬_D (∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y) dA**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Left Side (The Macroscopic View):** The line integral `∮_C (P dx + Q dy)` measures the total circulation of the field *around the boundary*. It tells you how much the current pushes you along as you walk the entire shoreline counter-clockwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Right Side (The Microscopic View):** The double integral `∬_D (∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y) dA` measures the sum of all the \"microscopic spinning\" *inside* the region. The term `(∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y)` is called the 2D **curl**, and it gives a value at each point that says how much a tiny paddlewheel would spin if you placed it there.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theorem's profound statement is that the sum of all the tiny spins inside the region exactly equals the overall flow around the boundary.\n",

    "#### Real-Life Usages\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Calculating Area with a Planimeter:** Green's Theorem is the principle behind a clever mechanical device called a planimeter, which measures the area of a shape by tracing its boundary. By setting `∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y = 1`, we can find a line integral that calculates area. For instance, if we choose `P = -y/2` and `Q = x/2`, then `∂Q/∂x - ∂P/∂y = 1/2 - (-1/2) = 1`. The theorem then says:\n",
    "    **Area of D = ∬_D 1 dA = ∮_C (-y/2 dx + x/2 dy)**\n",
    "    This means you can find the area of any complex shape just by integrating along its edge!\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Fluid Dynamics and Aerodynamics:** In designing things like airplane wings, engineers want to understand the **lift force**. This force is related to the circulation of air around the wing. While measuring the flow at every point inside a region is impossible, measuring the flow along a boundary loop is feasible. Green's theorem provides the theoretical link between these two.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Electromagnetism:** In 2D, a version of Ampere's Law (a fundamental law of electricity and magnetism) can be expressed using Green's Theorem. It relates the magnetic field circulating around a loop to the electric current flowing through the loop.\n",

    "\n",
    "The full proof can be quite technical, but we can prove it for a simple region to understand exactly why it works. The theorem is made of two parts:\n",
    "1.  `∮_C P dx = -∬_D (∂P/∂y) dA`\n",
    "2.  `∮_C Q dy = ∬_D (∂Q/∂x) dA`\n",
    "If we can prove both of these, we can just add them together to get the full theorem. Let's prove the first part.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Prove `∮_C P dx = -∬_D (∂P/∂y) dA` for a simple region `D`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine our region `D` is \"vertically simple,\" meaning it's bounded below by a curve `y = g₁(x)` and above by `y = g₂(x)`, from `x=a` to `x=b`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step A: Let's evaluate the right-hand side (RHS) first.**\n",
    "`RHS = -∬_D (∂P/∂y) dA`\n",
    "1.  We write this double integral as an iterated integral:\n",
    "    `= - ∫_a^b [ ∫_(g₁(x))^(g₂(x)) (∂P/∂y) dy ] dx`\n",
    "2.  Now, focus on the inner integral: `∫ (∂P/∂y) dy`. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, integrating a derivative just gives you back the original function. So, this becomes `P(x, y)`.\n",
    "3.  We evaluate `P(x, y)` at the bounds `y = g₂(x)` and `y = g₁(x)`:\n",
    "    The inner integral is `P(x, g₂(x)) - P(x, g₁(x))`.\n",
    "4.  Now, we plug this back into the outer integral:\n",
    "    `RHS = - ∫_a^b [ P(x, g₂(x)) - P(x, g₁(x)) ] dx`\n",
    "    `RHS = ∫_a^b P(x, g₁(x)) dx - ∫_a^b P(x, g₂(x)) dx`\n",
    "    Let's hold onto this result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step B: Now, let's evaluate the left-hand side (LHS).**\n",
    "`LHS = ∮_C P dx`\n",
    "1.  The closed path `C` is made of four pieces: the bottom curve (`C₁`), the right vertical line (`C₂`), the top curve (`C₃`), and the left vertical line (`C₄`).\n",
    "2.  **For the vertical lines `C₂` and `C₄`:** Along these paths, `x` is constant (`x=b` and `x=a`). This means the change in x, `dx`, is zero. Therefore, `∫ P dx = 0` for both `C₂` and `C₄`.\n",
    "3.  **For the bottom curve `C₁`:** We travel from left to right. We can parameterize this as `x=t`, `y=g₁(t)`, where `t` goes from `a` to `b`. So `dx = dt`. The integral becomes:\n",
    "    `∫_C₁ P dx = ∫_a^b P(t, g₁(t)) dt`\n",
    "4.  **For the top curve `C₃`:** We travel from right to left to keep the path counter-clockwise. We parameterize it as `x=t`, `y=g₂(t)`, but here `t` goes from `b` to `a`.\n",
    "    `∫_C₃ P dx = ∫_b^a P(t, g₂(t)) dt`\n",
    "    We can flip the bounds of an integral if we multiply by -1:\n",
    "    `= - ∫_a^b P(t, g₂(t)) dt`\n",
    "5.  Now, let's add up all four pieces for the LHS:\n",
    "    `LHS = (∫_a^b P(t, g₁(t)) dt) + (0) + (-∫_a^b P(t, g₂(t)) dt) + (0)`\n",
    "    `LHS = ∫_a^b P(x, g₁(x)) dx - ∫_a^b P(x, g₂(x)) dx`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step C: Compare the results.**\n",
    "The result from Step A is identical to the result from Step B. We have successfully shown that `∮_C P dx = -∬_D (∂P/∂y) dA`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The proof for the `Q` part of the theorem is done in the exact same way, but by defining the region as \"horizontally simple.\" Adding the two proven parts together gives us the full Green's Theorem. The magic is that all the internal parts of the region cancel out, leaving only the effect on the boundary.\n",
