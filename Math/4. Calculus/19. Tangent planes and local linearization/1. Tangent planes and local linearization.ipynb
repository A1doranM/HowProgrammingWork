    "### What is a Tangent Plane?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Intuition: The 3D Tangent Line\n",
    "In single-variable calculus, the **tangent line** is the line that \"just touches\" a curve at a single point and has the same slope as the curve at that point. It's the best *linear* approximation of the function near that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **tangent plane** is the direct, 3D equivalent for a surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tangent plane is a flat plane that \"just touches\" a surface at a single point, `P₀`, and has the same \"tilt\" as the surface at that point.\n",
    "*   It contains all the tangent lines to all possible curves that lie on the surface and pass through the point `P₀`.\n",
    "*   It serves as the **local linearization** of the function. This means if you zoom in infinitely close to the point `P₀` on the surface, the curved surface becomes indistinguishable from its flat tangent plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Analogy:** Imagine placing a flat sheet of cardboard on the surface of a globe. The cardboard is tangent to the globe at the point where it rests. It accurately represents the \"ground\" in the immediate vicinity of that point, which is why the Earth looks flat to us locally.\n",

    "### Controlling a Plane in Space\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can compute a tangent plane, we need to know how to define *any* plane in 3D space.\n",
    "\n",
    "To uniquely define a plane, you need two essential ingredients:\n",
    "1.  **A Point on the Plane:** One specific point that the plane passes through, let's call it `P₀ = (x₀, y₀, z₀)`.\n",
    "2.  **A Normal Vector:** A vector **n** = `<a, b, c>` that is **normal (perpendicular)** to the plane. This vector defines the plane's \"tilt\" or orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Formula (Point-Normal Form):**\n",
    "If you have a point `P₀` and a normal vector **n**, the equation of the plane is derived from a geometric property: any vector lying *in* the plane must be perpendicular to the normal vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let `P = (x, y, z)` be any other point on the plane. The vector from `P₀` to `P` is **v** = `<x - x₀, y - y₀, z - z₀>`. Since **v** is in the plane, **n** ⋅ **v** = 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us the standard equation of a plane:\n",
    "**a(x - x₀) + b(y - y₀) + c(z - z₀) = 0**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Computing a Tangent Plane\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we combine the two ideas. To find the tangent plane to a surface `z = f(x, y)` at a point `P₀ = (x₀, y₀)`, we need to find our two ingredients: a point and a normal vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The Point:** This is the easy part. The point of tangency is `(x₀, y₀, z₀)`, where `z₀ = f(x₀, y₀)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The Normal Vector:** This is the brilliant calculus connection. How do we find a vector perpendicular to our surface?\n",
    "    1.  **Rearrange the equation:** Rewrite the surface `z = f(x, y)` as a **level surface** of a new function, `g`.\n",
    "        `g(x, y, z) = f(x, y) - z = 0`\n",
    "    2.  **Use the Gradient:** We know from our study of gradients that the **gradient of a function `g` is always normal to its level surfaces**. So, `∇g` will be our normal vector **n**.\n",
    "    3.  **Compute the Gradient `∇g`:**\n",
    "        `∇g = < ∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y, -1 >`\n",
    "        So, our normal vector is **n** = `< f_x(x₀, y₀), f_y(x₀, y₀), -1 >`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Assemble the Equation:** Now we plug our point and normal vector into the point-normal formula:\n",
    "    `[f_x(x₀, y₀)] * (x - x₀) + [f_y(x₀, y₀)] * (y - y₀) + [-1] * (z - z₀) = 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **The Final Formula (Most Common Form):**\n",
    "    Rearranging the equation above to solve for `z` gives the most useful form for the tangent plane, which also serves as the local linearization `L(x, y)` of the function at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **z - z₀ = f_x(x₀, y₀)(x - x₀) + f_y(x₀, y₀)(y - y₀)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Calculation Example\n",
    "Find the equation of the tangent plane to the surface `f(x, y) = 3x² - y²` at the point `(2, 1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Find the point `(x₀, y₀, z₀)`:**\n",
    "    *   `x₀ = 2`, `y₀ = 1`\n",
    "    *   `z₀ = f(2, 1) = 3(2)² - (1)² = 11`\n",
    "    *   The point of tangency is `(2, 1, 11)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Find the partial derivatives `f_x` and `f_y`:**\n",
    "    *   `f_x(x, y) = 6x`\n",
    "    *   `f_y(x, y) = -2y`\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Evaluate the partial derivatives at the point `(2, 1)`:**\n",
    "    *   `f_x(2, 1) = 12`\n",
    "    *   `f_y(2, 1) = -2`\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Plug everything into the final formula:**\n",
    "    *   `z - 11 = 12(x - 2) - 2(y - 1)`\n",
    "    *   This is the equation of the tangent plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **The Local Linearization `L(x,y)` is:**\n",
    "    *   `L(x, y) = 11 + 12(x - 2) - 2(y - 1)`\n",
    "    *   For values of `(x, y)` very close to `(2, 1)`, the value of `L(x,y)` will be an excellent approximation for `f(x,y)`.\n",
