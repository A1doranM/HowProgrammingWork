    "#### Theory\n",
    "In single-variable calculus, we know that if you \"zoom in\" on a differentiable function `y = f(x)` at a point `x=a`, the curve looks more and more like a straight line. This line is the tangent line, and its equation is the linear approximation of the function:\n",
    "`f(x) ≈ f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)`\n",
    "\n",
    "This same idea applies to multivariable functions. A function `F` that takes multiple inputs and produces multiple outputs is **locally linear**. If we zoom in on a point in the input space, the complex twisting and stretching that the function performs on the space looks more and more like a simple **linear transformation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A linear transformation (like rotation, scaling, or shearing) can be represented by a **matrix**. The **Jacobian matrix** is the matrix that represents this best local linear approximation to a multivariable function.\n",

    "*   Single-variable derivative `f'(a)`: A **scalar** that describes the local \"stretching factor\" of the function.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "The Jacobian matrix is the matrix of all first-order **partial derivatives** of a vector-valued function. It completely describes the local linear behavior of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a function `F` that maps from `n`-dimensional space to `m`-dimensional space. Let the input variables be `x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ` and the output component functions be `f₁, f₂, ..., fₘ`.\n",

    "### The Jacobian Determinant\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "The **Jacobian determinant** is only defined for functions that map between spaces of the **same dimension** (e.g., from 2D to 2D, or 3D to 3D). In this case, the Jacobian matrix is a **square matrix**, so we can calculate its determinant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The determinant of the Jacobian matrix, often written as `det(J)` or `∂(x,y)/∂(r,θ)`, has a crucial geometric meaning: it represents the **local scaling factor for area (in 2D) or volume (in 3D)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   If you take a tiny rectangular area `dA = dr dθ` in the input space (polar coordinates).\n",
    "*   The function `F` maps this to a slightly warped parallelogram-like area in the output space (Cartesian coordinates).\n",
    "*   The area of this new region is `dx dy`, and the relationship is:\n",
    "    **dx dy = |det(J)| dr dθ**\n",
    "\n",
    "The absolute value of the Jacobian determinant is the \"stretching factor\" that tells you how much the function expands or shrinks areas/volumes when it transforms the space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculation Example\n",
    "Let's find the Jacobian determinant for our polar-to-Cartesian transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **We have the Jacobian matrix:**\n",
    "    **J_F =**\n",
    "    | cos(θ) | -r*sin(θ) |\n",
    "    | :---: | :---: |\n",
    "    | sin(θ) | r*cos(θ) |\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Calculate the determinant:**\n",
    "    *   `det(J) = (cos(θ)) * (r*cos(θ)) - (-r*sin(θ)) * (sin(θ))`\n",
    "    *   `det(J) = r*cos²(θ) + r*sin²(θ)`\n",
    "    *   `det(J) = r * (cos²(θ) + sin²(θ))`\n",
    "    *   `det(J) = r * (1) = r`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "*   The area scaling factor is `r`. This means that regions close to the origin (`r=0`) are shrunk, while regions far from the origin are stretched significantly. This makes perfect sense when you visualize a polar grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-Life Usage: Change of Variables in Multiple Integrals\n",
    "This is the primary application. When you want to solve a double or triple integral, you might change variables to make the region of integration simpler (e.g., from a circle in Cartesian coordinates to a rectangle in polar coordinates).\n",
    "\n",
    "You cannot just replace `dx dy` with `dr dθ`. You must include the area scaling factor, which is the Jacobian determinant.\n",
    "`∫∫_R f(x,y) dx dy = ∫∫_S f(r*cosθ, r*sinθ) * |r| dr dθ`\n",
    "The extra `r` in the polar integral is the Jacobian determinant we just calculated!\n",
