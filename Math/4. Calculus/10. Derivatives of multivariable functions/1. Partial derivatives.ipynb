    "### Partial Derivatives and the Formal Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "In single-variable calculus, the derivative `dy/dx` tells us the instantaneous rate of change of a function `y=f(x)`. It's the \"slope\" of the function at a point.\n",
    "\n",
    "In multivariable calculus, a function like `z = f(x, y)` depends on two or more variables. So, how does it \"change\"? The answer is that it can change differently depending on which input variable we modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **partial derivative** is the rate of change of a multivariable function when we allow **only one** of its input variables to change, while holding all other input variables constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Procedure:**\n",
    "To find the partial derivative of `f` with respect to `x` (denoted `∂f/∂x` or `f_x`), you treat all other variables (like `y`) as if they were constants. You then differentiate the function as you normally would. The same applies to finding the partial derivative with respect to `y` (`∂f/∂y`), where you would treat `x` as a constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formal Definition:**\n",
    "The formal definition is a direct extension of the limit definition from single-variable calculus.\n",
    "*   The partial derivative of `f` with respect to `x` is:\n",
    "    **∂f/∂x = lim_{h→0} [f(x+h, y) - f(x, y)] / h**\n",
    "    (Notice that only `x` is changed by `h`, while `y` is held fixed).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The partial derivative of `f` with respect to `y` is:\n",
    "    **∂f/∂y = lim_{h→0} [f(x, y+h) - f(x, y)] / h**\n",
    "    (Here, only `y` is changed by `h`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Calculation Example\n",
    "Let's find the partial derivatives of the function **f(x, y) = 3x² + 4xy² - 5y³**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Find the partial derivative with respect to `x` (∂f/∂x):**\n",
    "*   **Rule:** Treat `y` as a constant.\n",
    "*   **Term 1 (`3x²`):** The derivative of `3x²` with respect to `x` is `6x`.\n",
    "*   **Term 2 (`4xy²`):** Since `y` is a constant, `4y²` is the constant coefficient of `x`. The derivative of `(constant) * x` is just the constant. So, the derivative is `4y²`.\n",
    "*   **Term 3 (`-5y³`):** Since `y` is a constant, `-5y³` is entirely a constant. The derivative of a constant is `0`.\n",
    "*   **Combine:** `∂f/∂x = 6x + 4y² + 0 = 6x + 4y²`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Find the partial derivative with respect to `y` (∂f/∂y):**\n",
    "*   **Rule:** Treat `x` as a constant.\n",
    "*   **Term 1 (`3x²`):** Since `x` is a constant, `3x²` is entirely a constant. Its derivative is `0`.\n",
    "*   **Term 2 (`4xy²`):** `4x` is the constant coefficient of `y²`. The derivative of `y²` is `2y`. So, the derivative is `4x * (2y) = 8xy`.\n",
    "*   **Term 3 (`-5y³`):** The derivative of `-5y³` with respect to `y` is `-15y²`.\n",
    "*   **Combine:** `∂f/∂y = 0 + 8xy - 15y² = 8xy - 15y²`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-Life Usage\n",
    "*   **Thermodynamics:** The Ideal Gas Law states `P = (nRT)/V`, where pressure `P` is a function of temperature `T` and volume `V`. A physicist might want to know how pressure changes with volume at a constant temperature. This is the partial derivative `∂P/∂V`.\n",
    "*   **Economics:** The output of a factory `Q` might depend on the amount of labor `L` and capital `K` invested, `Q = f(L, K)`. The partial derivative `∂Q/∂L` represents the **marginal productivity of labor**: how much extra output you get for adding one more unit of labor while keeping capital fixed.\n",

    "### Graphical Understanding of Partial Derivatives\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "Imagine the function `z = f(x, y)` as a physical surface, like a mountain range. The `x` and `y` axes are the map coordinates (e.g., longitude and latitude), and `z` is the altitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Graphical meaning of ∂f/∂x:**\n",
    "    1.  Pick a point `(x₀, y₀)` on the map.\n",
    "    2.  Slice the mountain with a vertical plane that runs parallel to the x-axis, passing through your point. This is the plane `y = y₀`.\n",
    "    3.  The intersection of this plane and the surface creates a 2D curve.\n",
    "    4.  **`∂f/∂x` at `(x₀, y₀)` is the slope of the tangent line to that curve at that point.** It tells you how steep the surface is if you were to walk from that point in the positive x-direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Graphical meaning of ∂f/∂y:**\n",
    "    1.  This is the same idea, but you slice the mountain with a plane parallel to the y-axis (`x = x₀`).\n",
    "    2.  **`∂f/∂y` is the slope of the tangent line to *this* new curve.** It's the steepness you feel when walking in the positive y-direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Calculation Example\n",
    "Let's evaluate the partial derivatives of our function `f(x, y) = 3x² + 4xy² - 5y³` at the point **(1, 2)**.\n",
    "*   We found `∂f/∂x = 6x + 4y²`.\n",
    "*   We found `∂f/∂y = 8xy - 15y²`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Evaluate `∂f/∂x` at (1, 2):**\n",
    "    *   `∂f/∂x (1, 2) = 6(1) + 4(2)² = 6 + 4(4) = 6 + 16 = 22`.\n",
    "    *   **Interpretation:** At the point (1, 2) on the surface, if we hold `y` constant and move one unit in the positive x-direction, the value of `z` is increasing at a rate of 22 units. This is a very steep upward slope in the x-direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Evaluate `∂f/∂y` at (1, 2):**\n",
    "    *   `∂f/∂y (1, 2) = 8(1)(2) - 15(2)² = 16 - 15(4) = 16 - 60 = -44`.\n",
    "    *   **Interpretation:** At the same point (1, 2), if we hold `x` constant and move one unit in the positive y-direction, the value of `z` is *decreasing* at a rate of 44 units. This is an even steeper downward slope in the y-direction.\n",

    "### Symmetry of Second Partial Derivatives (Clairaut's Theorem)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "Just as we can take second derivatives in single-variable calculus, we can take **second partial derivatives**. We can differentiate our first partial derivatives again with respect to either `x` or `y`. This gives us four possibilities:\n",
    "1.  `f_xx = ∂/∂x (∂f/∂x) = ∂²f/∂x²`\n",
    "2.  `f_yy = ∂/∂y (∂f/∂y) = ∂²f/∂y²`\n",
    "3.  `f_xy = ∂/∂y (∂f/∂x) = ∂²f/∂y∂x` (Differentiate wrt `x` first, then wrt `y`).\n",
    "4.  `f_yx = ∂/∂x (∂f/∂y) = ∂²f/∂x∂y` (Differentiate wrt `y` first, then wrt `x`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two are \"pure\" second derivatives, while the last two are **mixed partial derivatives**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clairaut's Theorem** states that if the mixed second partial derivatives `f_xy` and `f_yx` are continuous on a disk around a point `(a, b)`, then they are **equal** at that point.\n",
    "**f_xy(a, b) = f_yx(a, b)**\n",
    "\n",
    "For most functions you will encounter (polynomials, sines, cosines, exponentials, etc.), this condition holds, meaning **the order of differentiation in mixed partials does not matter**. This is a beautiful and often surprising result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Calculation Example\n",
    "Let's prove this for our function `f(x, y) = 3x² + 4xy² - 5y³`.\n",
    "*   We have the first derivatives: `f_x = 6x + 4y²` and `f_y = 8xy - 15y²`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Calculate `f_xy`:** Differentiate `f_x` with respect to `y`.\n",
    "    *   `f_xy = ∂/∂y (6x + 4y²) = 0 + 8y = 8y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Calculate `f_yx`:** Differentiate `f_y` with respect to `x`.\n",
    "    *   `f_yx = ∂/∂x (8xy - 15y²) = 8y - 0 = 8y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Compare:** `f_xy = 8y` and `f_yx = 8y`. They are indeed equal, as predicted by Clairaut's Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-Life Usage\n",
    "*   **Physics:** This property is fundamental to many areas. In electromagnetism, the symmetry of second partials in Maxwell's equations shows a deep relationship between how changing electric fields create magnetic fields and how changing magnetic fields create electric fields.\n",
    "*   **Fluid Dynamics:** The condition for a fluid flow to be \"irrotational\" (without vortices) is `∂v/∂x = ∂u/∂y`, where `u` and `v` are velocity components. This condition is deeply connected to the symmetry of second partials of a \"potential function\" that can describe the flow.\n",
