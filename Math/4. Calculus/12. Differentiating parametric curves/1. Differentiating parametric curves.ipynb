    "### Vector-Valued Functions and their Differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "A **vector-valued function** is a function whose input is a single real number (a scalar), but whose output is a vector. We typically use the scalar `t` as the input, often representing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function defines a path or curve in space by giving the position vector `r(t)` for any given time `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:** A vector-valued function is defined by its component functions, which are regular single-variable functions:\n",
    "    *   In 2D: **r(t) = < x(t), y(t) >**\n",
    "    *   In 3D: **r(t) = < x(t), y(t), z(t) >**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differentiation**\n",
    "If `r(t)` represents the **position** of an object at time `t`, then its derivative, `r'(t)`, represents the **velocity** of the object at that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule for differentiating a vector-valued function is elegantly simple: **differentiate each component function with respect to `t`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:** **r'(t) = < x'(t), y'(t), z'(t) >**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geometric Interpretation of the Derivative `r'(t)`**\n",
    "The derivative `r'(t)` is a **vector** with two crucial properties:\n",
    "1.  **Direction:** It is **tangent** to the curve at the point `r(t)`. It points in the direction the object is moving at that exact moment.\n",
    "2.  **Magnitude:** Its magnitude, `||r'(t)||`, is the **speed** of the object at time `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second derivative, `r''(t)`, represents the **acceleration vector**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculation Example\n",
    "Consider a particle moving along a path defined by `r(t) = < 2cos(t), 3sin(t) >`. This traces out an ellipse. Let's analyze it at `t = π/2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Find the position at `t = π/2`:**\n",
    "    *   `r(π/2) = < 2cos(π/2), 3sin(π/2) > = < 2(0), 3(1) > = <0, 3>`\n",
    "    *   At this time, the particle is at the point (0, 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Differentiate `r(t)` to find the velocity function `r'(t)`:**\n",
    "    *   `x'(t)` = derivative of `2cos(t)` is `-2sin(t)`.\n",
    "    *   `y'(t)` = derivative of `3sin(t)` is `3cos(t)`.\n",
    "    *   **r'(t) = < -2sin(t), 3cos(t) >**\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Find the velocity vector at `t = π/2`:**\n",
    "    *   `r'(π/2) = < -2sin(π/2), 3cos(π/2) > = < -2(1), 3(0) > = <-2, 0>`\n",
    "    *   At the point (0, 3), the object is moving in the direction of the vector `<-2, 0>`, which is straight to the left. This makes sense for an ellipse traced counter-clockwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Find the speed at `t = π/2`:**\n",
    "    *   `Speed = ||r'(π/2)|| = ||<-2, 0>|| = √((-2)² + 0²) = √4 = 2`.\n",
    "    *   The instantaneous speed at this moment is 2 units per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-Life Usage\n",
    "*   **Computer Graphics & Animation:** Animators define the motion of characters or objects using vector-valued functions. The derivative helps them calculate realistic motion blur (which depends on velocity) and smooth transitions.\n",
    "*   **Robotics:** The path of a robot arm from one point to another is programmed as a vector-valued function of time. The derivative is crucial for ensuring the velocity and acceleration are within the physical limits of the motors.\n",
    "*   **Physics (Projectile Motion):** The path of a cannonball is `r(t) = < (v₀cosθ)t, (v₀sinθ)t - 0.5gt² >`, where `v₀` is initial velocity, `θ` is launch angle, and `g` is gravity. Differentiating gives its velocity at any time.\n",

    "### The Differential of a Vector-Valued Function\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "The **differential** is a formal concept that underpins linear approximation. While the derivative `r'(t)` is a velocity vector, the differential `dr` is an infinitesimal displacement vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:** **dr = r'(t) dt**\n",
    "    *   `dr` is the differential vector.\n",
    "    *   `r'(t)` is the derivative (velocity vector).\n",
    "    *   `dt` is an infinitesimal change in the input parameter `t`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Geometric Interpretation**\n",
    "The differential `dr` is a tiny vector that lies **on the tangent line** to the curve at the point `r(t)`. It represents the linear approximation of the actual change in position, `Δr`, when `t` changes by a small amount `Δt`. For very small changes, `Δr ≈ dr`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`Δr = r(t + Δt) - r(t)`** is the actual change along the curve (a tiny secant vector).\n",
    "*   **`dr = r'(t) dt`** is the approximate change along the tangent line.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept is the foundation for many important ideas, especially **arc length**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **length** of the differential vector is `||dr|| = ||r'(t) dt|| = ||r'(t)|| dt`. Since `||r'(t)||` is the speed, this just means `(differential distance) = speed * (differential time)`. This magnitude, `ds = ||dr||`, is called the **differential arc length**, which is integrated to find the total length of a curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculation Example\n",
    "Using our previous example, `r(t) = < 2cos(t), 3sin(t) >`, with `r'(t) = < -2sin(t), 3cos(t) >`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The differential `dr` is the vector:\n",
    "`dr = < -2sin(t) dt, 3cos(t) dt >`\n",
    "\n",
    "At the point `t = π/2`, the differential is:\n",
    "`dr = < -2sin(π/2) dt, 3cos(π/2) dt > = < -2 dt, 0 dt >`\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells us that for a tiny change in time `dt` from the point `t=π/2`, the particle's position changes by approximately `-2dt` in the x-direction and `0` in the y-direction. This matches our velocity vector `<-2, 0>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Code Illustration\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will use `sympy` to perform the symbolic differentiation and `matplotlib` to visualize the curve `r(t)` and its tangent velocity vector `r'(t)` at a specific point.\n",
