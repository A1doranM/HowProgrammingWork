    "### Optimizing Multivariable Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a surface instead of a line. In single-variable calculus, you find the maximum or minimum of a curve, like the peak of a hill or the bottom of a valley. In multivariable calculus, we're doing the same thing but for a 3D surface with hills, valleys, and other interesting features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to find the coordinates (like `(x, y)`) that give us the maximum or minimum value of a function `f(x, y)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we need to understand a few key concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Critical Points\n",
    "\n",
    "First, where do we even look for these highest or lowest points?\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in single-variable calculus where the peaks and valleys occur where the slope (the derivative) is zero, in multivariable calculus, the peaks, valleys, and other special points occur where the slopes in *all directions* are zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "We measure these slopes using **partial derivatives**. A partial derivative is just the slope of the function in one specific direction (e.g., only in the x-direction, treating y as a constant).\n",
    "\n",
    "A **critical point** is a point `(x, y)` where the partial derivatives of the function with respect to *all* variables are simultaneously zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Partial derivative with respect to x:** `∂f/∂x` or `fx`\n",
    "*   **Partial derivative with respect to y:** `∂f/∂y` or `fy`\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to find the critical points, we solve the system of equations:\n",
    "`fx(x, y) = 0`\n",
    "`fy(x, y) = 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "The solutions to this system give us the coordinates of all the potential maxima, minima, and other special points we need to investigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Classifying Critical Points: Maxima, Minima, and Saddle Points\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a critical point, we need to figure out what it is. Is it a hilltop (maximum), a valley bottom (minimum), or something else? To do this, we use the **Second Partial Derivative Test**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sounds intimidating, but it's just a way to check the *curvature* of the surface at that point. Think of it like this:\n",
    "*   If the surface is shaped like an upside-down bowl at that point, it's a **local maximum**.\n",
    "*   If it's shaped like a right-side-up bowl, it's a **local minimum**.\n",
    "*   If it's shaped like a horse's saddle, it's a **saddle point**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **saddle point** is a point that looks like a minimum in one direction but a maximum in another. Imagine sitting on a horse's saddle: the point where you sit is the lowest point along the horse's spine (from head to tail) but the highest point if you look across the horse's back (from side to side). A function is neither truly at a maximum nor a minimum at a saddle point.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. The Second Partial Derivative Test\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform the test, we first need to calculate all the **second partial derivatives**:\n",
    "*   `fxx(x, y)`: Take the partial derivative with respect to `x` twice.\n",
    "*   `fyy(x, y)`: Take the partial derivative with respect to `y` twice.\n",
    "*   `fxy(x, y)`: Take the partial derivative with respect to `x`, then with respect to `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we calculate a special value called the **Discriminant (D)**, which is defined at the critical point `(a, b)`:\n",
    "\n",
    "**D = fxx(a, b) * fyy(a, b) - [fxy(a, b)]²**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can classify the critical point `(a, b)` using these rules:\n",
    "1.  If **D > 0** and **fxx(a, b) > 0**: The point is a **local minimum**. (The surface is \"concave up\", like a bowl.)\n",
    "2.  If **D > 0** and **fxx(a, b) < 0**: The point is a **local maximum**. (The surface is \"concave down\", like a dome.)\n",
    "3.  If **D < 0**: The point is a **saddle point**.\n",
    "4.  If **D = 0**: The test is inconclusive. We don't know what the point is without more analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's find and classify the critical points of the function:\n",
    "**f(x, y) = x² - 2xy + y³ - y**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Find the critical points (where `fx = 0` and `fy = 0`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `fx = 2x - 2y`\n",
    "*   `fy = -2x + 3y² - 1`\n",
    "\n",
    "Set them to zero:\n",
    "1.  `2x - 2y = 0`  => `x = y`\n",
    "2.  `-2x + 3y² - 1 = 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, substitute `x = y` from the first equation into the second:\n",
    "*   `-2(y) + 3y² - 1 = 0`\n",
    "*   `3y² - 2y - 1 = 0`\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a quadratic equation. We can factor it to `(3y + 1)(y - 1) = 0`.\n",
    "This gives us two solutions for `y`:\n",
    "*   `y = 1`\n",
    "*   `y = -1/3`\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `x = y`, our critical points are **(1, 1)** and **(-1/3, -1/3)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Use the Second Partial Derivative Test**\n",
    "\n",
    "First, calculate the second partial derivatives:\n",
    "*   `fxx = 2` (from `fx = 2x - 2y`)\n",
    "*   `fyy = 6y` (from `fy = -2x + 3y² - 1`)\n",
    "*   `fxy = -2` (from `fx = 2x - 2y`)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, calculate the Discriminant `D = (fxx)(fyy) - (fxy)² = (2)(6y) - (-2)² = 12y - 4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Classify each critical point**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **For the point (1, 1):**\n",
    "    *   `D = 12(1) - 4 = 8`\n",
    "    *   Since `D = 8` (which is > 0) and `fxx = 2` (which is > 0), the point **(1, 1)** is a **local minimum**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **For the point (-1/3, -1/3):**\n",
    "    *   `D = 12(-1/3) - 4 = -4 - 4 = -8`\n",
    "    *   Since `D = -8` (which is < 0), the point **(-1/3, -1/3)** is a **saddle point**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-Life Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Business - Maximizing Profit:**\n",
    "A company produces two products, A and B. The profit function depends on the number of units of A (`x`) and B (`y`) sold. The function might be complex, accounting for manufacturing costs, demand curves, and competition. The company wants to find the production levels `(x, y)` that lead to the maximum profit. They would find the critical points of their profit function to identify this optimal production strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Engineering - Minimizing Material Usage:**\n",
    "An engineer wants to design an open-topped box with a specific volume. The amount of material used depends on the length (`l`) and width (`w`) of the base. To minimize cost, the engineer needs to find the dimensions `(l, w)` that minimize the surface area (material used) for the given volume. This is a multivariable optimization problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Code Illustration\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python code uses `sympy` for symbolic math (to find derivatives and solve equations) and `matplotlib` for creating a 3D plot to visualize the function's surface, its critical points, and their classification.\n",
