    "Excellent. The final step in our journey through basic inference is to compare two independent groups. This is one of the most common scenarios in statistics, used to answer questions like \"Is treatment A more effective than treatment B?\" or \"Is there a difference in the average salary for two different professions?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the theory and procedures for comparing two means.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### The Sampling Distribution of the Difference in Sample Means\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "Imagine we have two distinct populations. Population 1 has a true mean `μ₁` and standard deviation `σ₁`. Population 2 has a true mean `μ₂` and standard deviation `σ₂`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We take a random sample of size `n₁` from Population 1 and calculate its mean `x̄₁`. We independently take another random sample of size `n₂` from Population 2 and find its mean `x̄₂`. Our statistic of interest is the **difference between these two sample means: `x̄₁ - x̄₂`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to repeat this process many times, the distribution of all possible values of `x̄₁ - x̄₂` is called the **sampling distribution of the difference in sample means**. It has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Center (Mean):** The mean of this sampling distribution is the true difference between the population means.\n",
    "    *   **μ_{x̄₁-x̄₂} = μ₁ - μ₂**\n",
    "*   **Spread (Standard Deviation):** When we combine two independent random variables, their variances **add**. We use the sample standard deviations `s₁` and `s₂` because the population values are unknown. The resulting standard deviation is called the **standard error of the difference**.\n",
    "    *   **SE_{x̄₁-x̄₂} = √[ (s₁²/n₁) + (s₂²/n₂) ]**\n",
    "*   **Shape (Conditions):** For the sampling distribution to be approximately Normal, a set of conditions must be met for **both** samples.\n",
    "    1.  **Random:** Both samples must be drawn randomly from their respective populations.\n",
    "    2.  **Independent (10% Rule):** Both `n₁` and `n₂` must be less than 10% of their respective population sizes.\n",
    "    3.  **Independent Groups:** The two samples must be independent of each other. The selection of one sample cannot influence the selection of the other. This is the opposite of paired data.\n",
    "    4.  **Normal/Large Sample:** Both samples must satisfy the Normal/Large Sample condition (either the population is stated to be Normal, or `n ≥ 30`, or a plot of the sample data for a small sample shows no strong skew or outliers).\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two-Sample t-interval for the Difference Between Means\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "This interval provides a range of plausible values for the true difference between two population means, `μ₁ - μ₂`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:** **(x̄₁ - x̄₂) ± t* * √[ (s₁²/n₁) + (s₂²/n₂) ]**\n",
    "*   `(x̄₁ - x̄₂)` is our point estimate for the difference.\n",
    "*   `t*` is the critical value from a t-distribution.\n",
    "*   The square root term is the standard error.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Degrees of Freedom (df) for Two Samples\n",
    "This is the trickiest part. The exact degrees of freedom are calculated with a complex formula (the Welch-Satterthwaite equation), which is what statistical software uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "For calculations by hand, we use a simpler, more conservative approach:\n",
    "**Conservative df = the smaller of (n₁ - 1) or (n₂ - 1)**\n",
    "This approach gives a slightly wider (less precise) interval but is accepted as a valid method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation\n",
    "The most important value to look for in the final interval is **zero**.\n",
    "*   If the interval **contains zero**, it means that a difference of zero is a plausible value. Therefore, we do not have convincing evidence of a difference between the two population means.\n",
    "*   If the interval is **entirely positive or entirely negative** (it does not contain zero), we have strong evidence that a real difference exists between the two population means.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two-Sample t-test for the Difference Between Means\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "This test assesses the evidence for a claim that there is a difference between two population means.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Hypotheses:** The null hypothesis is typically that there is no difference.\n",
    "    *   **H₀: μ₁ - μ₂ = 0**  (or `μ₁ = μ₂`)\n",
    "    *   **Hₐ: μ₁ - μ₂ > 0, < 0, or ≠ 0**\n",
    "*   **Test Statistic (`t`):** The formula follows the standard pattern: (Statistic - Parameter) / (Standard Error).\n",
    "    *   **t = [ (x̄₁ - x̄₂) - 0 ] / √[ (s₁²/n₁) + (s₂²/n₂) ]**\n",
    "*   **P-value:** Found from the area in the tail(s) of a t-distribution, using either the complex software-calculated `df` or the conservative `smaller of (n₁-1, n₂-1)` `df`.\n",

    "**Scenario:** A school district wants to know if there's a difference in the mean end-of-year math scores between two different teaching methods. A group of 40 students uses Method A, and an independent group of 50 students uses Method B. The results are below. First, perform a significance test (`α = 0.05`), then construct a 95% confidence interval.\n",

    "*   **Method A:** `n₁ = 40`, `x̄₁ = 83.5`, `s₁ = 5.2`\n",

    "*   **Conditions:**\n",
    "    *   Random/Independent Groups: We assume students were randomly assigned to each method.\n",

    "    *   Normal/Large Sample: `n₁=40` and `n₂=50` are both `≥ 30`. The CLT applies. Conditions are met.\n",
