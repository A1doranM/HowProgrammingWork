    "### Introduction to Inference about Slope\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "When we create a scatterplot and find the line of best fit (the least-squares regression line), we get an equation of the form **`ŷ = a + bx`**.\n",
    "*   `b` is the **sample slope**. It's a statistic calculated from our sample data.\n",
    "*   `a` is the **sample y-intercept**.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is just an *estimate* based on one sample. We assume there is a \"true\" but unknown regression line for the entire population, with the equation **`y = α + βx`**.\n",
    "*   **`β` (beta)** is the **true population slope**. This is the parameter we are interested in.\n",
    "*   **`α` (alpha)** is the **true population y-intercept**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core question of inference is: **Is the relationship we see in our sample (`b`) strong enough to conclude that there is a real linear relationship in the population (`β`)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "What if there were actually no linear relationship at all between the two variables? In that case, the true population slope would be zero (`β = 0`). The goal of a significance test is to see if our sample slope `b` is far enough from zero that we can reject the idea that the true slope `β` is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **sampling distribution of the slope** describes what the values of the sample slope `b` would look like if we took many, many random samples from the same population. Under the right conditions, this distribution is a t-distribution centered at the true slope `β`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypotheses\n",
    "*   **Null Hypothesis (H₀): `β = 0`**. This implies there is **no linear relationship** between the two variables in the population. Any slope we see in our sample is just due to random chance.\n",
    "*   **Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ):** Can be one of three forms:\n",
    "    *   `β > 0` (There is a positive linear relationship).\n",
    "    *   `β < 0` (There is a negative linear relationship).\n",
    "    *   `β ≠ 0` (There is *some* linear relationship, either positive or negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditions for Inference on Slope\n",
    "\n",
    "For our calculations (both tests and intervals) to be valid, a set of conditions must be met. These can be remembered with the acronym **LINER**.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **L - Linear:** The actual relationship between the variables in the population must be linear.\n",
    "    *   **How to check:** Examine a **scatterplot** of the data. It should show a roughly linear pattern. Also, create a **residual plot** (a plot of the residuals vs. the x-values). The residual plot should show no obvious pattern, just random scatter around zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **I - Independent:** Individual observations must be independent of each other. When sampling without replacement, this is the **10% Rule**: the sample size `n` should be no more than 10% of the population size `N`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **N - Normal:** The residuals must be approximately Normally distributed. This means that for any given x-value, the y-values are Normally distributed around the true regression line.\n",
    "    *   **How to check:** Create a **histogram** or a **Normal probability plot** of the residuals. The histogram should be roughly symmetric and bell-shaped.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **E - Equal Variance (Homoscedasticity):** The standard deviation of the residuals must be the same for all x-values.\n",
    "    *   **How to check:** Look at the **residual plot** again. The points should form a random band of consistent width around the zero line. There should be no \"fanning out\" (cone shape), which would indicate that the model's predictions get worse as `x` increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **R - Random:** The data must be collected from a well-designed random sample or randomized experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### Confidence Interval for the Slope of a Regression Line\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "A confidence interval for the slope provides a range of plausible values for the true population slope, `β`. The structure is the same as every other interval we've studied.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:** **`b ± t* * SE_b`**\n",
    "*   `b` is the sample slope from our data.\n",
    "*   `SE_b` is the **Standard Error of the Slope**. This complex formula measures the typical variability of the sample slope `b` from the true slope `β`.\n",
    "*   `t*` is the critical t-value for a given confidence level. The degrees of freedom for regression slope inference are **df = n - 2**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpretation\n",
    "The most important part of interpreting the interval is to **look for the value 0**.\n",
    "*   If the confidence interval for the slope **contains 0**, then it is plausible that the true slope is zero. This means we do not have convincing evidence of a linear relationship between the variables.\n",
    "*   If the confidence interval **does not contain 0** (it is entirely positive or entirely negative), then we have strong evidence that the true slope is not zero. This means there is a statistically significant linear relationship between the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Example\n",
    "**Scenario:** A real estate agent wants to model the relationship between the size of a house (in square feet) and its selling price (in thousands of dollars). She takes a random sample of 20 houses. Computer output for the regression analysis is shown below. Construct a 95% confidence interval for the true slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computer Output:**\n",
    "*   Predictor: House Size\n",
    "*   Sample size `n = 20`\n",
    "*   Coefficient (Slope `b`): 0.150\n",
    "*   Standard Error of the Slope (`SE_b`): 0.025\n",
    "\n",
    "**STATE:**\n",
    "*   We want to find a 95% confidence interval for `β`, the true slope of the regression line relating house price to its size.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PLAN:**\n",
    "*   **Procedure:** We will construct a t-interval for the slope `β`.\n",
    "*   **Conditions:** We would check the LINER conditions using scatterplots and residual plots of the data. For this example, we will assume the conditions have been met.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DO:**\n",
    "1.  **Find `t*`:**\n",
    "    *   `df = n - 2 = 20 - 2 = 18`.\n",
    "    *   For 95% confidence with df=18, the critical value is **`t* = 2.101`**.\n",
    "2.  **Calculate the interval:**\n",
    "    *   `b ± t* * SE_b`\n",
    "    *   `0.150 ± 2.101 * 0.025`\n",
    "    *   `0.150 ± 0.0525`\n",
    "    *   Interval: **(0.0975, 0.2025)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**CONCLUDE:**\n",
    "*   \"We are 95% confident that the interval from 0.0975 to 0.2025 captures the true slope of the regression line relating a house's price to its size.\"\n",
    "*   **Interpretation in context:** Since the interval is entirely positive and does not contain 0, we have convincing evidence of a significant positive linear relationship between size and price. For each additional square foot of size, we are 95% confident that the true mean increase in price is between $97.50 and $202.50 (since prices were in thousands).\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Code Illustration\n",
    "\n",
    "This code uses `scikit-learn` to get the slope and then manually calculates the standard error and the confidence interval, which is highly instructive.\n",
