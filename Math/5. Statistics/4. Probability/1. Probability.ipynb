    "### Intro to Theoretical Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "**Theoretical Probability** is a way of measuring the chance of an event happening based on pure logic and reasoning, without performing any experiments. It's what we *expect* to happen in an ideal world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundation of theoretical probability is the idea of equally likely outcomes. If every possible outcome has the same chance of occurring, we can use a simple formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "**P(Event) = (Number of Favorable Outcomes) / (Total Number of Possible Outcomes)**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Favorable Outcomes:** The specific outcomes you are interested in.\n",
    "*   **Total Possible Outcomes:** The complete set of all possible results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability is always a number between 0 and 1:\n",
    "*   **P = 0** means the event is impossible.\n",
    "*   **P = 1** means the event is certain.\n",
    "*   **P = 0.5** means the event is just as likely to happen as it is not to happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculation Example\n",
    "Let's find the theoretical probability of drawing a Queen from a standard 52-card deck.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Identify the Favorable Outcomes:** We want to draw a Queen. There are four Queens in a deck (Queen of Hearts, Queen of Diamonds, Queen of Clubs, Queen of Spades).\n",
    "    *   *Number of Favorable Outcomes = 4*\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Identify the Total Possible Outcomes:** There are 52 unique cards in the deck.\n",
    "    *   *Total Number of Possible Outcomes = 52*\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Calculate the Probability:**\n",
    "    *   P(Drawing a Queen) = 4 / 52\n",
    "    *   This simplifies to **1 / 13**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the theoretical probability of drawing a Queen is 1/13, or about 7.7%.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-Life Usage\n",
    "*   **Games of Chance:** Casino games are built on theoretical probability. The probability of a roulette wheel landing on a single number (e.g., '7') is 1/38 (on an American wheel with 0 and 00). This precise, unchangeable probability allows the casino to calculate its long-term profit.\n",
    "*   **Genetics:** A biologist can use a Punnett square to determine the theoretical probability of offspring inheriting certain genetic traits. For example, if two parents both carry one dominant allele (B) and one recessive allele (b) for brown eyes, the theoretical probability of their child having blue eyes (bb) is 1/4 or 25%.\n",

    "### Experimental vs. Theoretical Probability Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "This concept highlights the difference between what *should* happen in theory and what *actually* happens when you test it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Theoretical Probability** (Recap): Calculated based on perfect conditions. A fair coin *should* land on heads 50% of the time.\n",
    "*   **Experimental Probability:** Calculated by performing an experiment (or simulation) and counting the results. It's what you observe.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **P(Event) = (Number of Times Event Occurred) / (Total Number of Trials)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important concept connecting the two is the **Law of Large Numbers**. This law states that as you perform more and more trials in an experiment, the experimental probability will get closer and closer to the theoretical probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simulation Example\n",
    "Let's simulate rolling a standard six-sided die.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Event:** Rolling a '4'.\n",
    "*   **Theoretical Probability:** There is one '4' on the die and six total sides.\n",
    "    *   P(Rolling a '4') = **1/6 ≈ 0.167** (or 16.7%).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's run an experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Experiment 1 (Small Trial):** You roll the die 12 times. The results are: `1, 5, 5, 6, 2, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5, 1, 4`.\n",
    "    *   The number '4' appeared 2 times.\n",
    "    *   **Experimental Probability = 2 / 12 = 1/6 ≈ 0.167**. In this case, by pure chance, the experimental probability matched the theoretical one perfectly. It could just as easily have been 0/12 or 4/12.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Experiment 2 (Another Small Trial):** You roll the die 12 more times. This time, the number '4' appears only once.\n",
    "    *   **Experimental Probability = 1 / 12 ≈ 0.083**. This is very different from the theoretical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Experiment 3 (Large Trial):** You roll the die 6,000 times. A likely result would be that the number '4' appears about 990 times.\n",
    "    *   **Experimental Probability = 990 / 6000 = 0.165**. This result is extremely close to the theoretical probability of 0.167.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-Life Usage\n",
    "*   **Quality Control:** A factory produces 100,000 light bulbs a day. It's impossible to calculate the *theoretical* probability of a bulb being defective. Instead, they perform an *experiment*: they test a random sample of 500 bulbs and find that 2 are defective. Their experimental probability of a defect is 2/500 = 0.4%. They use this data to predict the number of defective bulbs in the entire day's production.\n",
    "*   **Weather Forecasting:** A meteorologist runs 100 different computer simulations of the atmosphere for the next day. If 70 of those simulations result in rain, they report a 70% chance of rain. This is an experimental probability derived from a simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",

    "This code simulates rolling a die many times and plots how the experimental probability converges toward the theoretical probability, demonstrating the Law of Large Numbers.\n",
