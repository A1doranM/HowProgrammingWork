    "### The Core Idea: The Chi-Square (χ²) Statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "Both tests are built around the same fundamental idea. We compare the **Observed Counts** in our data table to the **Expected Counts** we would expect to see *if the null hypothesis were true*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Chi-Square (χ²) test statistic** measures how far the observed counts are from the expected counts. A large value means a big discrepancy, while a small value means the observed data is very close to what was expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Formula:** **χ² = Σ [ (Observed - Expected)² / Expected ]**\n",
    "    *   `Observed`: The actual count from your sample data in a given cell.\n",
    "    *   `Expected`: The count you would expect in that cell if H₀ were true.\n",
    "    *   You calculate the `(O-E)²/E` value for **every cell** in the table and then **sum (Σ)** them all up.\n",
    "\n",
    "A large χ² value suggests that the null hypothesis is unlikely to be true. We use this statistic to find a P-value from a **chi-square distribution**, which is defined by **degrees of freedom (df) = (number of rows - 1) * (number of columns - 1)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Chi-Square Test for Homogeneity\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "*   **The Question:** \"Is the distribution of a single categorical variable the **same** (homogeneous) across two or more different populations?\"\n",
    "*   **The Data Collection:** You take **multiple independent random samples**, one from each population you want to compare. Then, you classify each subject in those samples according to one categorical variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypotheses\n",
    "*   **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** The distribution of [categorical variable] is the same for all populations.\n",
    "*   **Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ):** The distribution of [categorical variable] is *not* the same for all populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Example\n",
    "**Scenario:** A marketing firm wants to know if the preferred social media platform is the same for different age groups. They take a random sample of 100 Teens, a separate random sample of 100 Young Adults, and a final separate random sample of 100 Adults.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observed Data Table:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| | Teenagers | Young Adults | Adults | **Row Total** |\n",
    "| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n",
    "| **TikTok** | 60 | 40 | 10 | **110** |\n",
    "| **Instagram** | 30 | 45 | 25 | **100** |\n",
    "| **Facebook** | 10 | 15 | 65 | **90** |\n",
    "| **Column Total** | **100** | **100** | **100** | **300** |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculations (The \"DO\" Step):**\n",
    "1.  **Calculate Expected Counts:** The formula for each cell is **(Row Total * Column Total) / Grand Total**.\n",
    "    *   Expected(Teenagers, TikTok) = (110 * 100) / 300 ≈ **36.7**\n",
    "    *   Expected(Adults, Facebook) = (90 * 100) / 300 = **30.0**\n",
    "    *   ...and so on for every cell.\n",
    "2.  **Calculate the χ² statistic:** For each cell, find `(O-E)²/E` and sum them.\n",
    "    *   Cell (Teenagers, TikTok): `(60 - 36.7)² / 36.7 ≈ 14.7`\n",
    "    *   Cell (Adults, Facebook): `(65 - 30.0)² / 30.0 ≈ 40.8`\n",
    "    *   ...after doing this for all 9 cells, you sum them up to get the final `χ²` value. Let's say it comes out to **`χ² = 72.8`**.\n",
    "3.  **Find the P-value:**\n",
    "    *   `df = (3 rows - 1) * (3 columns - 1) = 2 * 2 = 4`.\n",
    "    *   The P-value is the probability of getting a `χ²` statistic of 72.8 or greater on a distribution with df=4. This P-value will be extremely small (virtually zero).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "*   Since the P-value is less than any reasonable `α` (like 0.05), we **reject H₀**. We have very strong evidence that the distribution of preferred social media platforms is **not the same** across these three age groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Chi-Square Test for Association (Independence)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "*   **The Question:** \"Is there an **association** (or relationship) between two categorical variables within a **single population**?\" This is equivalent to asking if the two variables are **independent**.\n",
    "*   **The Data Collection:** You take **one single random sample** from one population. Then, you classify each subject according to **two different categorical variables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypotheses\n",
    "*   **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** There is no association between [Variable 1] and [Variable 2]. (They are independent).\n",
    "*   **Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ):** There is an association between [Variable 1] and [Variable 2]. (They are dependent).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Example\n",
    "**Scenario:** A sociologist takes a single random sample of 300 university students and asks each of them two questions: 1) \"What is your primary academic division?\" and 2) \"Do you live on-campus or off-campus?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observed Data Table:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| | On-Campus | Off-Campus | **Row Total** |\n",
    "| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n",

    "**Calculations (The \"DO\" Step):**\n",
    "The process is identical to the test for homogeneity.\n",
    "1.  **Calculate Expected Counts:** Formula is **(Row Total * Column Total) / Grand Total**.\n",
    "    *   Expected(Arts & Sci, On-Campus) = (120 * 140) / 300 = **56.0**\n",
    "    *   Expected(Business, Off-Campus) = (100 * 160) / 300 ≈ **53.3**\n",
    "2.  **Calculate the χ² statistic:** Sum the `(O-E)²/E` for all cells.\n",
    "    *   Cell (Arts & Sci, On-Campus): `(70 - 56.0)² / 56.0 ≈ 3.5`\n",
    "    *   ...after summing all 6 cells, let's say we get **`χ² = 15.6`**.\n",
    "3.  **Find the P-value:**\n",
    "    *   `df = (3 rows - 1) * (2 columns - 1) = 2 * 1 = 2`.\n",
    "    *   The P-value is `P(χ²₂ ≥ 15.6)`. This is a very small number, `≈ 0.0004`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "*   Since the P-value (0.0004) is less than `α` (0.05), we **reject H₀**. We have strong evidence of an **association** between a student's academic division and their housing status. They are not independent variables.\n",

    "### Conditions for Both Chi-Square Tests\n",
    "\n",
    "For the results of either test to be valid, we must check three conditions:\n",
    "1.  **Random:** The data must be collected using a random sample or samples.\n",
    "2.  **Independent (10% Rule):** When sampling without replacement, each sample size should be no more than 10% of its respective population.\n",
    "3.  **Large Counts:** **All expected counts must be greater than or equal to 5.** This is the most important condition. If any expected count is less than 5, the chi-square model is not appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Code Illustration\n",
    "\n",
    "The `scipy.stats.chi2_contingency` function is used for both tests. It takes the table of observed counts as input and returns the `χ²` statistic, the P-value, the degrees of freedom, and the table of expected counts.\n",
