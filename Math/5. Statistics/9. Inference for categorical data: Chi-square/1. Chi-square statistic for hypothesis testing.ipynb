    "### The Chi-Square (χ²) Statistic for Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "The **Chi-Square (χ²) statistic** is a measure used to test hypotheses about categorical data. Its fundamental purpose is to compare the **observed counts** in our sample to the **expected counts** we would anticipate if the null hypothesis were true.\n",
    "\n",
    "It answers the question: **\"Is the difference between what I observed in my sample and what I expected to see large enough to be considered statistically significant?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the chi-square statistic is:\n",
    "**χ² = Σ [ (Observed - Expected)² / Expected ]**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the components of this formula:\n",
    "*   **Observed (O):** The actual number of observations in our sample that fall into a specific category.\n",
    "*   **Expected (E):** The number of observations we would expect to see in that category if the null hypothesis (the claim we are testing) were true.\n",
    "*   **(Observed - Expected):** This is the raw difference for one category.\n",
    "*   **(Observed - Expected)²:** We square this difference so that all contributions are positive (it doesn't matter if we observed more or less than expected, only how far off we were) and to give more weight to larger differences.\n",
    "*   **/ Expected:** We divide by the expected count to standardize the squared difference. A difference of 10 is very significant if you only expected 5, but not very significant if you expected 1000.\n",
    "*   **Σ (Sum):** We add up these standardized, squared differences for *all* categories to get one overall test statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Properties of the χ² Statistic and its Distribution:**\n",
    "*   **Always Non-Negative:** Since it's a sum of squared numbers, `χ²` can never be negative. `χ² = 0` means the observed counts perfectly match the expected counts.\n",
    "*   **Right-Skewed Distribution:** The chi-square distribution is not symmetric like the Normal or t-distributions. It starts at 0 and has a long tail to the right.\n",
    "*   **Degrees of Freedom (df):** Like the t-distribution, the specific shape of the chi-square distribution is determined by its degrees of freedom. The `df` calculation depends on the type of chi-square test being performed.\n",
    "*   **Always a Right-Tailed Test:** A larger `χ²` value indicates a greater discrepancy between our data and the null hypothesis. Therefore, a \"more extreme\" result is always one with a larger `χ²` value. This means that to find the **P-value**, we always find the area in the **right tail** of the distribution.\n",

    "### Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit (GOF) Test\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "The **Goodness-of-Fit (GOF) test** is used to determine if the distribution of a **single categorical variable** in a population matches a claimed or hypothesized distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, it could test claims like:\n",
    "*   \"A bag of M&M's contains 13% red, 14% yellow, 24% blue...\"\n",
    "*   \"A die is fair\" (meaning the proportion of each outcome is 1/6).\n",
    "*   \"The distribution of customer arrivals by day of the week is uniform.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The test follows the standard four-step process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Example: Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit\n",
    "**Scenario:** A major candy company claims that the color distribution for its flagship product is: **30% Blue, 20% Green, 20% Red, 15% Orange, and 15% Yellow**. A student buys a large bag containing 200 candies and counts the colors. Their results are: **72 Blue, 35 Green, 38 Red, 23 Orange, and 32 Yellow**. Does this sample provide convincing evidence that the company's claimed distribution is incorrect? Use `α = 0.05`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**STATE:**\n",
    "*   **Hypotheses:**\n",
    "    *   **H₀:** The company's claimed color distribution is correct.\n",
    "        (`p_blue = 0.30, p_green = 0.20, p_red = 0.20, p_orange = 0.15, p_yellow = 0.15`)\n",
    "    *   **Hₐ:** The company's claimed color distribution is incorrect. (At least one of the proportions is different from what is claimed).\n",
    "*   **Significance Level:** `α = 0.05`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PLAN:**\n",
    "*   **Test:** We will perform a **Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit test**.\n",
    "*   **Check Conditions:**\n",
    "    *   **Random:** We will assume the large bag represents a random sample of the company's production.\n",
    "    *   **Independent (10% Rule):** The sample size `n=200` is clearly less than 10% of all candies produced.\n",
    "    *   **Large Counts:** We must check that all **expected counts** are at least 5. We calculate the expected counts based on the null hypothesis (`Expected = n * p_hypothesized`).\n",
    "        *   Expected Blue: 200 * 0.30 = 60\n",
    "        *   Expected Green: 200 * 0.20 = 40\n",
    "        *   Expected Red: 200 * 0.20 = 40\n",
    "        *   Expected Orange: 200 * 0.15 = 30\n",
    "        *   Expected Yellow: 200 * 0.15 = 30\n",
    "    *   All expected counts are well above 5, so the condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DO:**\n",
    "1.  **Calculate the χ² statistic:** We'll use a table to organize the calculation.\n",
    "\n",
