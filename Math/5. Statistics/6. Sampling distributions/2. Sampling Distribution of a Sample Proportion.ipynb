    "### Sampling Distribution of a Sample Proportion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "Imagine a large population where a certain proportion, `p`, has a specific characteristic (e.g., the proportion of all voters who support a candidate). It's usually impossible to ask everyone, so we take a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **sample proportion**, denoted **p̂** (read \"p-hat\"), is the proportion of that characteristic found in our single sample. `p̂ = (number of successes in sample) / (sample size n)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, imagine we take *many* different random samples of the same size `n` from that population. Each sample would likely have a slightly different `p̂`. The **sampling distribution of the sample proportion** is the distribution formed by all these possible `p̂` values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This distribution has a predictable center and spread:\n",
    "*   **Mean (Center):** The mean of all the possible `p̂` values is equal to the true population proportion, `p`.\n",
    "    *   **μ_{p̂} = p**\n",
    "*   **Standard Deviation (Spread):** This measures the typical distance between a sample proportion (`p̂`) and the population proportion (`p`). It's often called the **standard error of the proportion**.\n",
    "    *   **σ_{p̂} = √[ p(1-p) / n ]**\n",
    "    *   Notice that as the sample size `n` gets larger, the standard deviation gets smaller, meaning our sample proportions will be clustered more tightly around the true mean `p`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculation Example\n",
    "Suppose that in a large city, **60%** (`p = 0.60`) of residents own a pet. We decide to take random samples of **100** people (`n=100`).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The sampling distribution of `p̂` will have a **mean** of:\n",
    "    *   `μ_{p̂} = p = 0.60`\n",
    "*   It will have a **standard deviation** of:\n",
    "    *   `σ_{p̂} = √[ 0.60(1-0.60) / 100 ] = √[ 0.24 / 100 ] = √0.0024 ≈ 0.049`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:** This means if we repeatedly take samples of 100 residents, the sample proportion of pet owners will, on average, be 60%. A typical sample proportion is expected to be about 0.049 (or 4.9 percentage points) away from this true mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-Life Usage\n",
    "*   **Election Polling:** A pollster surveys 1,000 people and finds `p̂ = 55%` support for a candidate. The sampling distribution tells them how much this `p̂` is likely to vary from the true population support `p` just due to random sampling error.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normal Conditions for Sampling Distributions of Sample Proportions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem tells us that under the right conditions, the shape of the sampling distribution of `p̂` is **approximately Normal**. This is incredibly useful because it allows us to use Z-scores to calculate probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two conditions that must be met are:\n",
    "1.  **10% Condition (for Independence):** The sample size `n` should be no more than 10% of the population size `N` (`n ≤ 0.10N`). This allows us to assume that individual selections are independent even when sampling without replacement.\n",
    "2.  **Large Counts Condition (for Normality):** The sample size `n` must be large enough so that we expect to see at least 10 \"successes\" and at least 10 \"failures\". This ensures the Normal curve is a good approximation for the shape of the distribution.\n",
    "    *   **np ≥ 10**  and  **n(1-p) ≥ 10**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculation Example\n",
    "Using our pet ownership example: `p = 0.60`, `n = 100`.\n",
    "1.  **10% Condition:** We assume the city has more than 1,000 residents (10 * 100), so this condition is met.\n",
    "2.  **Large Counts Condition:**\n",
    "    *   `np = 100 * 0.60 = 60`. This is ≥ 10.\n",
    "    *   `n(1-p) = 100 * 0.40 = 40`. This is ≥ 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since both conditions are met, we can say that the sampling distribution of `p̂` is approximately **Normal** with a mean of 0.60 and a standard deviation of 0.049. We write this as `p̂ ~ N(μ=0.60, σ=0.049)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-Life Usage\n",
    "*   **Hypothesis Testing:** Before a researcher can perform a Z-test for a proportion, they *must* check these conditions. If the conditions fail, the P-value calculated from the Normal model will be inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability of Sample Proportions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "Once we've confirmed our sampling distribution is approximately Normal, we can find the probability of observing a sample proportion (`p̂`) within a certain range. The process is the same as finding probabilities for any Normal distribution: **calculate a Z-score**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Z-score formula for a sample proportion is:\n",
    "**Z = (p̂ - p) / σ_{p̂}**\n",
    "*   `p̂` is the sample proportion value we are interested in.\n",
    "*   `p` is the mean of the distribution (the true population proportion).\n",
    "*   `σ_{p̂}` is the standard deviation of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculation Example\n",
    "Continuing our pet example (`p=0.60, n=100, μ_{p̂}=0.60, σ_{p̂}=0.049`), what is the probability that a random sample of 100 residents will have a sample proportion of **less than 55%** (`p̂ < 0.55`)?\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Conditions:** We already verified them. The distribution is Normal.\n",
    "2.  **Find the Z-score:**\n",
    "    *   `Z = (0.55 - 0.60) / 0.049 = -0.05 / 0.049 ≈ -1.02`\n",
    "3.  **Find the probability:** We look up the probability for `Z < -1.02` using a Z-table or software.\n",
    "    *   `P(Z < -1.02) ≈ 0.1539`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:** There is about a 15.4% chance of getting a sample proportion of less than 55% pet owners, even when the true proportion is 60%.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-Life Usage\n",
    "*   **A/B Testing:** A company's website has a historical click-through rate of 10% (`p=0.10`). After a redesign, they show the new site to 500 visitors (`n=500`). They can calculate the probability of observing a new rate of 13% (`p̂=0.13`) or higher *if the redesign had no real effect*. If this probability is very low, they can conclude the redesign was successful.\n",

    "### Sampling Distribution of the Difference in Sample Proportions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theory\n",
    "Often, we want to compare two different populations. For example, do more men than women support a certain law? Here, we are interested in the **difference between two sample proportions**, `p̂₁ - p̂₂`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **sampling distribution of the difference** is the distribution of all possible values of `p̂₁ - p̂₂` if we were to take many samples from both populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Mean (Center):** The mean of the distribution is the true difference between the population proportions.\n",
    "    *   **μ_{p̂₁ - p̂₂} = p₁ - p₂**\n",
    "*   **Standard Deviation (Spread):** To find the variance of the difference, we **add** the individual variances. The standard deviation is the square root of that sum.\n",
    "    *   `σ²_{p̂₁ - p̂₂} = σ²_{p̂₁} + σ²_{p̂₂} = [p₁(1-p₁) / n₁] + [p₂(1-p₂) / n₂]`\n",
    "    *   **σ_{p̂₁ - p̂₂} = √[ (p₁(1-p₁)/n₁) + (p₂(1-p₂)/n₂) ]**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **conditions for Normality** must hold for **both** samples independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculation Example\n",
    "Let's say in City A, the true support for a project is 60% (`p₁=0.60`), and we sample 100 people (`n₁=100`). In City B, support is 52% (`p₂=0.52`), and we sample 150 people (`n₂=150`).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Mean of the difference:**\n",
    "    *   `μ_{p̂₁ - p̂₂} = 0.60 - 0.52 = 0.08`\n",
    "*   **Standard deviation of the difference:**\n",
    "    *   `σ_{p̂₁ - p̂₂} = √[ (0.60*0.40/100) + (0.52*0.48/150) ]`\n",
    "    *   `σ_{p̂₁ - p̂₂} = √[ 0.0024 + 0.001664 ] = √0.004064 ≈ 0.0637`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretation:** The sampling distribution for the difference `p̂₁ - p̂₂` will be approximately Normal with a mean of 0.08 and a standard deviation of 0.0637.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-Life Usage\n",
    "*   **Medical Studies:** Researchers want to compare the effectiveness of a new drug versus a placebo. `p₁` is the proportion of patients who recover with the drug, and `p₂` is the proportion who recover with the placebo. They analyze the distribution of `p̂₁ - p̂₂` to see if the new drug produces a statistically significant improvement.\n",
