    "# Statistics Intro: Mean, Median, & Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "These three measures are fundamental concepts in descriptive statistics. They are known as **measures of central tendency**, which means they try to describe the \"center\" or \"typical\" value of a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 1: Theory with Examples\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Mean (Average)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "The mean is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the number of values. It's what most people commonly refer to as the \"average.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula:**\n",
    "Mean = (Sum of all values) / (Number of values)\n",
    "Or, using mathematical notation:\n",
    "μ (for population mean) or x̄ (for sample mean) = Σx / n\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "*   Σ (sigma) represents the sum of\n",
    "*   x represents each individual value in the dataset\n",
    "*   n represents the total number of values\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use:**\n",
    "*   When the data is numerical and symmetrically distributed (e.g., follows a normal distribution).\n",
    "*   When you want a measure that incorporates every value in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to be Cautious:**\n",
    "*   The mean is sensitive to **outliers** (extreme values). A single very high or very low value can significantly skew the mean, making it less representative of the typical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Consider the dataset: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sum of all values:** 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30\n",
    "2.  **Number of values:** 5\n",
    "3.  **Mean:** 30 / 5 = 6\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example with an Outlier:**\n",
    "Consider the dataset: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 100]` (100 is an outlier)\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sum of all values:** 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 100 = 120\n",
    "2.  **Number of values:** 5\n",
    "3.  **Mean:** 120 / 5 = 24\n",
    "    *Notice how the mean (24) is pulled towards the outlier (100) and isn't very representative of the other values (2, 4, 6, 8).*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Median\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "The median is the middle value in a dataset that has been sorted in ascending (or descending) order. It divides the dataset into two equal halves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to Find:**\n",
    "1.  **Sort the data:** Arrange all values from smallest to largest.\n",
    "2.  **Find the middle value:**\n",
    "    *   **If the number of values (n) is odd:** The median is the single middle value. The position is `(n+1)/2`.\n",
    "    *   **If the number of values (n) is even:** The median is the average of the two middle values. The positions are `n/2` and `(n/2) + 1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use:**\n",
    "*   When the data is numerical and might be skewed or contain outliers. The median is **robust** to outliers.\n",
    "*   For ordinal data (data that can be ranked).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Odd number of values):**\n",
    "Dataset: `[7, 2, 10, 5, 3]`\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sort the data:** `[2, 3, 5, 7, 10]`\n",
    "2.  **Number of values (n):** 5 (odd)\n",
    "3.  **Position of median:** (5 + 1) / 2 = 3rd value\n",
    "4.  **Median:** 5\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Even number of values):**\n",
    "Dataset: `[7, 2, 10, 5, 3, 12]`\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sort the data:** `[2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12]`\n",
    "2.  **Number of values (n):** 6 (even)\n",
    "3.  **Positions of middle values:**\n",
    "    *   `n/2` = 6/2 = 3rd value (which is 5)\n",
    "    *   `(n/2) + 1` = (6/2) + 1 = 4th value (which is 7)\n",
    "4.  **Median:** (5 + 7) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example with an Outlier (revisiting the mean's outlier example):**\n",
    "Dataset: `[2, 4, 6, 8, 100]`\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sort the data:** `[2, 4, 6, 8, 100]`\n",
    "2.  **Number of values (n):** 5 (odd)\n",
    "3.  **Median:** 6\n",
    "    *Notice how the median (6) is much more representative of the typical non-outlier values compared to the mean (24) in this case.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:**\n",
    "The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset can have:\n",
    "*   **No mode:** If all values appear with the same frequency (e.g., each value appears only once).\n",
    "*   **One mode (unimodal):** If one value appears more frequently than any other.\n",
    "*   **Multiple modes (bimodal, trimodal, multimodal):** If two or more values appear with the same highest frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use:**\n",
    "*   For categorical data (e.g., colors, types of cars).\n",
    "*   For numerical data to identify the most common value(s).\n",
    "*   It's the only measure of central tendency that can be used with nominal data (data that can be named or labeled but not ordered or measured).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Unimodal):**\n",
    "Dataset: `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5]`\n",
    "*   The value `4` appears 3 times, which is more than any other value.\n",
    "*   **Mode:** 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (Bimodal):**\n",
    "Dataset: `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5]`\n",
    "*   The values `2` and `3` both appear 2 times, which is the highest frequency.\n",
    "*   **Modes:** 2, 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example (No Mode):**\n",
    "Dataset: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`\n",
    "*   Each value appears only once.\n",
    "*   **Mode:** No mode (or sometimes all values are considered modes, depending on convention, but \"no mode\" is common).\n",
