    "### The Four-Step Process for a Significance Test\n",
    "\n",
    "Carrying out a significance test is a structured process. We'll use the acronym **STATE, PLAN, DO, CONCLUDE**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Big Picture: What is a Significance Test?**\n",
    "A confidence interval's goal is to *estimate* a population parameter. A significance test's goal is to *assess the evidence provided by data against a claim* about that parameter. We are asking: \"Is the observed result statistically significant (unlikely to have happened by random chance alone), or could it have plausibly occurred by chance?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: STATE\n",
    "\n",
    "This step involves defining the hypotheses and the significance level.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypotheses:**\n",
    "Every test has two hypotheses that compete against each other.\n",
    "*   **The Null Hypothesis (H₀):** This is the \"status quo\" or \"no effect\" hypothesis. It's a statement of no difference or no change. It always includes a statement of equality. For a proportion, it takes the form:\n",
    "    *   **H₀: p = p₀** (where `p₀` is the hypothesized, or claimed, value)\n",
    "*   **The Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ):** This is the claim we are trying to find evidence *for*. It can take one of three forms:\n",
    "    *   **Hₐ: p > p₀** (a one-sided test, looking for an increase)\n",
    "    *   **Hₐ: p < p₀** (a one-sided test, looking for a decrease)\n",
    "    *   **Hₐ: p ≠ p₀** (a two-sided test, looking for any difference)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Significance Level (α):**\n",
    "This is the \"threshold of surprise.\" It's the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually true (a Type I error). We choose `α` *before* collecting data. Common levels are `α = 0.05` or `α = 0.01`. If our result is less likely than `α` to occur by chance, we'll consider it statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: PLAN\n",
    "\n",
    "This step involves naming the test and checking the conditions for its validity.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Name the test:** \"We will perform a **one-sample z-test for a population proportion `p`**.\"\n",
    "2.  **Check Conditions:** These are the same three conditions as for confidence intervals, with one crucial difference in the \"Large Counts\" check.\n",
    "    *   **Random:** The data must come from a random sample or randomized experiment.\n",
    "    *   **Independent (10% Rule):** Sample size `n` must be no more than 10% of the population `N`.\n",
    "    *   **Large Counts (Normality):** Since our entire test is based on the premise \"assuming the null hypothesis is true,\" we use the hypothesized proportion `p₀` from the null hypothesis to check this condition.\n",
    "        *   **n * p₀ ≥ 10** and **n * (1 - p₀) ≥ 10**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: DO\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the calculation step where we find our test statistic and the P-value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Calculating a z statistic in a test about a proportion**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theory:** The z-statistic measures how many standard deviations our sample statistic (`p̂`) is from the hypothesized parameter (`p₀`). It tells us how \"surprising\" our result is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula is:\n",
    "**z = (p̂ - p₀) / √[p₀(1-p₀)/n]**\n",
    "*   `p̂` = Your sample proportion (`x/n`).\n",
    "*   `p₀` = The hypothesized proportion from H₀.\n",
    "*   `√[p₀(1-p₀)/n]` = The standard deviation of the sampling distribution, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Calculating a P-value given a z statistic**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theory:** The **P-value** is the heart of the test. It's the answer to the question: **\"Assuming the null hypothesis is true, what is the probability of getting a sample result as extreme or more extreme than the one we actually observed?\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation depends on the alternative hypothesis:\n",
    "*   If **Hₐ: p > p₀**, the P-value is the area to the **right** of your z-statistic. `P-value = P(Z ≥ z)`.\n",
    "*   If **Hₐ: p < p₀**, the P-value is the area to the **left** of your z-statistic. `P-value = P(Z ≤ z)`.\n",
    "*   If **Hₐ: p ≠ p₀**, the P-value is the area in **both tails**. You find the area in one tail and **double it**. `P-value = 2 * P(Z ≥ |z|)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: CONCLUDE\n",
    "\n",
    "This final step involves making a decision and interpreting it in the context of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Making conclusions in a test about a proportion**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two steps to a good conclusion:\n",
    "1.  **Make a formal decision:** Compare your P-value to your significance level `α`.\n",
    "    *   If **P-value < α**, your result is statistically significant. You **reject the null hypothesis (H₀)**. There is convincing evidence for the alternative hypothesis (Hₐ).\n",
    "    *   If **P-value ≥ α**, your result is not statistically significant. You **fail to reject the null hypothesis (H₀)**. There is *not* convincing evidence for the alternative hypothesis (Hₐ).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **State your conclusion in context:** Write a sentence or two explaining what your decision means in terms of the original problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Crucial Nuance:** \"Failing to reject H₀\" does not mean you have proven H₀ is true. It simply means you lack sufficient evidence to say it's false. Think of a court case: a \"not guilty\" verdict doesn't mean the person is innocent, just that the prosecution failed to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Significance test for a proportion: Free Response Example\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:** A nationwide study showed that 70% of college students have a streaming subscription. A professor at a large state university (over 20,000 students) believes the proportion at her university is *lower*. She takes a random sample of 200 students and finds that 128 of them have a subscription. Does this provide convincing evidence for her belief at the `α = 0.05` significance level?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **STATE**\n",
    "*   **Parameter:** `p` = the true proportion of all students at this university who have a streaming subscription.\n",
    "*   **Null Hypothesis (H₀):** `p = 0.70` (The proportion at this university is the same as the national average).\n",
    "*   **Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ):** `p < 0.70` (The professor's belief that the proportion is lower).\n",
    "*   **Significance Level (α):** `α = 0.05`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **PLAN**\n",
    "*   **Test:** We will perform a one-sample z-test for a population proportion `p`.\n",
    "*   **Check Conditions:**\n",
    "    *   **Random:** The problem states a \"random sample\" was taken.\n",
    "    *   **Independent (10% Rule):** The sample size `n=200` is less than 10% of the 20,000+ students at the university.\n",
    "    *   **Large Counts (Normality):** We use `p₀ = 0.70`.\n",
    "        *   `n * p₀ = 200 * 0.70 = 140` (which is ≥ 10).\n",
    "        *   `n * (1 - p₀) = 200 * 0.30 = 60` (which is ≥ 10).\n",
    "    *   Conditions are met.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **DO**\n",
    "1.  **Calculate the sample proportion (`p̂`):**\n",
    "    *   `p̂ = 128 / 200 = 0.64`\n",
    "2.  **Calculate the z-statistic:**\n",
    "    *   `z = (0.64 - 0.70) / √[0.70(1-0.70)/200]`\n",
    "    *   `z = -0.06 / √[0.21/200] = -0.06 / √0.00105 ≈ -0.06 / 0.0324`\n",
    "    *   **z ≈ -1.85**\n",
    "3.  **Calculate the P-value:**\n",
    "    *   Since Hₐ is `p < 0.70`, we need the area to the left of our z-statistic.\n",
    "    *   `P-value = P(Z ≤ -1.85)`\n",
    "    *   Using a Z-table or calculator, this probability is **≈ 0.0322**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **CONCLUDE**\n",
    "1.  **Formal Decision:** Our P-value (0.0322) is less than our significance level `α` (0.05). Therefore, we **reject the null hypothesis (H₀)**.\n",
    "2.  **Conclusion in Context:** We have convincing statistical evidence to support the professor's belief that the proportion of students at her university with a streaming subscription is lower than the national average of 70%.\n",
