# Active Context: Deep Learning Framework

## Current Focus

The current development focus for the deep learning framework is on improving the project structure and test organization:

1. **Test Reorganization**: 
   - All test files have been moved into `deeplearning_framework/tests/` directory
   - Test imports have been updated to work from the new location
   - A dedicated test runner script has been created within the tests directory
   - The main test_framework.py integration test has been stabilized by adding a fixed random seed

2. **Memory Bank Creation**:
   - Documentation of framework structure and concepts
   - Creation of comprehensive reference material for the codebase

## Recent Changes

### Test Infrastructure Improvements

The testing infrastructure now follows a more standard Python package layout:

- Tests are now organized as part of the package in `deeplearning_framework/tests/`
- Each component has a dedicated test file:
  - `test_tensor.py`: Tests for the core Tensor functionality
  - `test_layers.py`: Tests for all layer implementations
  - `test_losses.py`: Tests for loss function implementations
  - `test_optim.py`: Tests for optimizer implementations
  - `test_framework.py`: End-to-end integration tests

The test runner has been updated to:
- Automatically discover all test files in the tests directory
- Run tests in a consistent order
- Provide a clear summary of test results

### Fixed Issues

Recent fixes to the framework include:

1. **Matrix Multiplication Gradient Calculation**:
   - Fixed the backward pass for matrix multiplication when dealing with vectors
   - Added comprehensive test cases for different input shapes

2. **MSE Loss Implementation**:
   - Corrected the loss calculation to properly sum across all dimensions
   - Ensured correct gradient propagation

3. **SGD Optimizer**:
   - Updated parameter update mechanism
   - Added control over gradient zeroing behavior

4. **XOR Test Reliability**:
   - Added fixed random seed for reproducible results
   - Increased network capacity and training iterations for more reliable convergence

## Current State

The framework is in a stable, working state. All core functionality is implemented and verified by tests:

- **Tensor Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, matrix multiplication
- **Neural Network Layers**: Linear, Sigmoid, Tanh, Sequential, Embedding, RNN
- **Loss Functions**: MSE, Cross Entropy
- **Optimizers**: SGD

All tests are currently passing, indicating that the implementation is correct.

## Next Steps

The following areas have been identified for potential future development:

### Short-term Priorities

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. **Performance**: The framework is not optimized for speed or memory efficiency
2. **Numerical Stability**: Some operations may have numerical stability issues with very large or small values
3. **Error Handling**: More informative error messages could be provided for common issues
4. **Feature Completeness**: Missing many advanced features found in production frameworks

## Questions and Decisions Pending

1. **API Consistency**: Should we standardize on PyTorch-like or TensorFlow-like API conventions?
2. **Feature Prioritization**: Which additional components would be most educational to implement next?
3. **Documentation Format**: What is the best documentation format for educational purposes?
