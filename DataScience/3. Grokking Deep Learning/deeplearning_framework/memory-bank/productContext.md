# Product Context: Deep Learning Framework

## Problem Domain

Modern deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow are powerful, but their complexity can obscure the fundamental principles at work. Their production-focused design prioritizes performance and feature completeness over readability and educational value.

This framework addresses the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation of deep learning systems by providing:

1. A transparent implementation of automatic differentiation (autograd)
2. Clear, concise implementation of neural network components
3. An approachable codebase that can be fully understood by a single developer

## User Needs

This framework serves several types of users:

### Deep Learning Students

- **Need**: Understand how autograd and backpropagation actually work
- **Problem**: Black-box nature of mainstream frameworks hides implementation details
- **Solution**: Fully transparent implementation with clear documentation

### Educators

- **Need**: Demonstrate deep learning concepts with real, working code
- **Problem**: Difficulty explaining the internals of production frameworks
- **Solution**: Clean, well-structured code that can be walked through line by line

### Researchers and Hobbyists

- **Need**: Experiment with custom neural network components
- **Problem**: Extending production frameworks requires understanding complex codebases
- **Solution**: Simple, extensible design that makes customization straightforward

## Functionality

The framework provides core functionality needed to build and train neural networks:

### Data Structures

- **Tensor**: Fundamental data structure with autograd capabilities
  - Supports basic operations (+, -, *, matrix multiply, etc.)
  - Tracks computation graph for backpropagation
  - Manages gradient flow during training

### Network Building Blocks

- **Layers**: Components that transform inputs in differentiable ways
  - Linear layers for fully-connected networks
  - Activation functions (Sigmoid, Tanh)
  - Embedding layers for working with discrete inputs
  - RNN cells for sequence processing

### Training Components

- **Loss Functions**: Measure model performance
  - Mean Squared Error for regression tasks
  - Cross Entropy with Softmax for classification

- **Optimizers**: Update model parameters during training
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

## Usage Patterns

The framework is designed to be used in the following ways:

1. **Educational Exploration**: Reading and understanding the codebase to learn about deep learning internals
2. **Simple Model Training**: Building basic models like MLPs and RNNs to solve toy problems
3. **Framework Extension**: Adding new components by inheriting from base classes
4. **Algorithm Prototyping**: Implementing and testing new deep learning algorithms in a controlled environment

## User Experience Goals

The framework is designed to provide:

1. **Clarity** - Well-commented code with clear logic flow
2. **Discoverability** - Intuitive structure that follows common deep learning patterns
3. **Feedback** - Clear error messages and debugging information
4. **Consistency** - Similar API patterns across different components
5. **Familiarity** - Interface similar to mainstream frameworks to ease transfer of knowledge

## Value Proposition

Unlike production deep learning frameworks that prioritize performance and feature completeness, this framework prioritizes:

1. **Educational Value**: Understanding how deep learning works
2. **Code Readability**: Clear implementation over optimization tricks
3. **Simplicity**: Core concepts without excessive abstraction
4. **Self-Containment**: Minimal dependencies (just NumPy)
