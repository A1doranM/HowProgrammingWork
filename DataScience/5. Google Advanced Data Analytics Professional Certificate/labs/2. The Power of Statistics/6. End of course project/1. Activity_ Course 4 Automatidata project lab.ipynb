    "**Note:** For the purpose of this exercise, assume that the sample data comes from an experiment in which customers are randomly selected and divided into two groups: 1) customers who are required to pay with credit card, 2) customers who are required to pay with cash. Without this assumption, we cannot draw causal conclusions about how payment method affects fare amount.\n",

    "**The goal** is to apply descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing in Python. The goal for this A/B test is to sample data and analyze whether there is a relationship between payment type and fare amount. For example: discover if customers who use credit cards pay higher fare amounts than customers who use cash.\n",

    "**Part 2:** Conduct EDA and hypothesis testing\n",
    "* How did computing descriptive statistics help you analyze your data? \n",
