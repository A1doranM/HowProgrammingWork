    "Fit with degree-10 polynomial (11 parameters):\n",
    "  → Wiggly, passes through exactly but crazy between points ✗\n",

    "Training samples: 100\n",

    "Many different weight configurations\n",

    "Like having 100 equations with 12 million unknowns\n",
    "→ Infinite solutions!\n",

    "### **Reason 3: Training Too Long**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Early training: Learning general patterns\n",
    "Later training: Memorizing noise and specifics\n",
    "\n",
    "It's like studying:\n",

    "Original loss: \"How wrong are predictions?\"\n",
