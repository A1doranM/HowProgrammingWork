       "array(['Moon like UFO hovers for minutes then ascends to appear to look like bright star, then dim star, then gone. This article will give you some information about my sighting of the \"Moon of Memphis\" and topics that the spirits talk and focus on.  This article may seem to some to be a UFO religion but the information is UFO evidence and spirit communications designed to integrate into your present beliefs and religion, not to replace them.   Hopefully this UFO sighting and news will improve your belief and devotion to God, other people, and all things living.  My UFO phenomenon began on the way to visit my grandmother in western Kentucky. We were riding north on Highway 51 late at night listening to the AM radio when we heard a news report of UFO’s seen in western Kentucky and western Tennessee. I looked out the back window at the stars above stating that I wish I could see a UFO. Twenty six days later I had my wish. I was back at home in Memphis when my mother asked me to take out the garbage at 10pm  Sunday 22 November 1964. I went out back and I looked up and saw a white full moon above then I looked around and to the east I saw an orange moon rising. I looked back above and noticed the white full moon shaped UFO again for a few minutes until it ascended in the sky looking like a bright star at high altitude. I believe this phenomenon was outside of my head and it was fantastic.  Since it appeared over the Holy Hills of the Frayser community of Memphis, I call it the \"Frayser Fatima\" of the \"Moon of Memphis\".  At 10pm 22 November of 1964 in Memphis Tennessee (USA), I was asked by my mother to take out the garbage. I went out back and I noticed a bright white full moon above. I looked closer and I noticed it had uniform whiteness with well define circular outline but I was not able to see the shades of white or grey that made the man in the moon face. It was equally as bright as the real full moon, bright enough to create a moon shadow. I looked around and I noticed another moon that was bright orange. This other moon was rising over our neighbor\\'s house to the east, as I looked through the side yard from the back yard to the front. It had the features that created the man in the moon, so I believed that it was the real moon. I looked above and stared again at the white full moon for a few minutes, then it made a rapid ascend in the sky. I estimate the ascend speed between 180 to 300 knots.  As it rose, it became a smaller and smaller moon until it appeared to looked like a bright ! star, then a dim star, then disappeared into space. It reminded me of the Star of Bethlehem when it was at high altitude.  The event occurred within a mile of the Area 51 of Tennessee, that is near Highway 51 over the Holy Hills of the Frayser neighborhood of Memphis, Tennessee and the event lasted about fifteen minutes.  I was only seven when I witnessed this UFO that I now call the \"Moon of Memphis\". I had a good memory of the event so that when I was trained in the Air Force as an instructor navigator, I was able to analyze the event better with my aviation experience. I estimate that the \"Moon of Memphis\" was at twenty thousand feet and was about ten acres in size. I developed this information from watching the ascend of the \"Moon of Memphis\" through some high cirrus clouds that I estimate was at sixty thousand feet. At twenty thousand feet it would have taken four 747 aircraft parked in a circle to cover the area of the \"Moon of Memphis\" UFO, thus creating a ten acre size estimate. When it hovered above me and 10 ten degrees south, it was exactly the size and shape of the real moon when seen high in the sky.  Most observers probably could not tell the difference between the \"Moon of Memphis\" UFO and the real lunar moon when it\\'s hovering above.   In 1964 the “Moon of Memphis” appeared at 10 pm 22 November over the city of Memphis. It was a night with two moons in the sky, the “Moon of Memphis” overhead and the lunar moon rising in the east. There is significance to this event because the timing of the event has biblical implications. First it appeared in 1964 which can be analyzed to derive meaning. If you take the alphabet and match the letters with numbers then you can derive a numeric number for words. I analyzed many religious words and I found two that are interesting. The English words \"Israel\", \"Zion\" and \"Jeshua\" decodes to 64 sixty four. Israel is a word that has meaning to the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim religions. The word Zion is a word that means Israel and Jerusalem in particular. In Revelations of the Bible, there is writing about a New Jerusalem or a new Zion. Could the timing of the “Moon of Memphis” mean that it was God’s New Jerusalem or Zion?  \"Jeshua\" is the Messiah of Israel that was translate! d to mean Jesus Christ.  The day of the month was the 22 twenty second which added to 11 eleven for the month of November equals 33 thirty three which is a religious number for the English word \"Amen\" and the crucifixion date of Jesus was 33 AD. If you count the 22 November to 25 December, then you will have 33 thirty three days.  Twenty two is also the sum of the word \"Lead\".  If you take the numeric sum of the appearance date: 11-22-1964, you get 26 which is the sum of the words \"God\" and \"heal\".  Also, my birthday 11-04-1964 of that year also added up to 26 and will always be the sum of the \"Moon of Memphis\" appearance anniversary which helps explain why I was given the honor to view it.   Lastly, the decoded English word \"Mercy\" equals 64 sixty four.  The UFO event occurred at 10 pm. Ten coincides with the English letter “J” which could mean Jewish, Jehovah, or Jesus.  The sum of the word \"ten\" equals 33 thirty three, a number often associated with Christ.   If we added the 10 ten to the 64 sixty four then we would get 74 seventy four. Seventy four has some religious meaning. The English words \"Messiah\", \"Jesus\", \"Cross\", and \"Jewish\"  decodes to 74 seventy four. Seeing meaning presumes that God intended for the year and time numbers to be added together. If we subtract 10 ten from 64 sixty four we get 54 fifty four. The English words \"Islam\" and \"Love\" adds up to 54 fifty four.  If you take the number of witnesses of the event 1 one and subtract 64 sixty four then you get 63 which is the sum for the words \"Saint\", \"try\", \"gentle\", \"agitate\", and \"Divine\". If you add the numbers of 1964, you get 20 twenty and if added to 64 sixty four you get 84 eighty four which is the decoded sum of the English words \"Savior\", \"evolved\"! , \" Patmos\", \"forty\", and \"Charity\".   If you add 33 thirty three to 64 sixty four you get 97 ninety seven and the English words \"convert\", \"story\", \"buildings\", \"control\", \"sixty\" and \"Hinduism\" equals 97.  If you decode the English word \"November\" the you get 94 ninety four which is also the decoded sum of the English word \"respected\"; if you add the 10 ten to 94 ninety four then you get 104 one hundred four which is the decoded sum of the English word \"Jerusalem\".  If you take the decoded sum of the English word \"Memphis\", you get 83 eighty three which is also the decoded sum of the English words \"percent\", \"prayer\", \"prepared\", and \"South\"; and if you subtract the time 10 ten then you get the sum 73 seventy three which is the decoded sum of the English words \"Joseph\", \"children\", \"thanks\", \"nation\", \"living\", and \"Ezekiel\";  If you take the sum of \"America\" which is 50 fifty and add 33 thirty three you get 83 eighty three for the sum of \"Memphis\".  If you add my age at ! the time of the event 7 seven to 64 sixty four you would get 7! 1 sevent y one which is the decoded sum of the English word \"spirit\" and \"Temple\".  If you subtract my age 7 seven from 64 sixty four then you get my birth year of 57 fifty seven which is the decoded sum of the English words \"Moon\", \"Jews\", \"Bless\", \"Mary\", \"birth\", \"human\", and \"city\".  I hope this analysis can help you understand the religious nature of the \"Moon of Memphis\" appearance of God which seems to reach out to believers of Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and others.   This witness of the event was born on 11-04- 1957 and 57 fifty seven is the numeric sum of the English word \"Moon\" and the English words \"Bless\", \"Mary\",  \"birth\",  \"city\" and \"Jews\"  which suggest that we should bless Mary and birth city of Jesus the Christ and Messiah.  The sum of my birth date is 28 which is the sum of the word \"Eden\".   Also English may have been chosen because England equals 57 fifty seven.  If you take the difference between 64 sixty four and 57 fifty seven you get 7 seven which subtracted from 57 fifty seven you get 50 fifty that decodes the words \"America\", \"second\", \"lands\", and \"helped\".  If you take the sum 67 sixty seven of my last name \"Bickers\" which is also the sum of the English words \"trees\", \"West\", and \"work\",  and add the time 10 ten, you get 77 seventy seven which is the sum of the English words \"Christ\",  \"wrong\", \"Power\", \"character\", \"Taoism\", and \"Judaism\".   If you take the sum 79 seventy nine of my first name \"William\" which also d! ecodes the English words \"Nature\", \"hereby\", and \"Virgin\", and subtract the time 10 ten then you get 69 sixty nine which is the sum of the English words \"message\", \"animals\", \"redeemed\", \"people\" and  \"Jehovah\". If you add 10 ten to 79 seventy nine, you get 89 eighty nine which is the sum of the word \"religion\".   If you take my middle name \"Harding\", it decodes to 61 sixty one which is also the sum of the English word \"Church\". If you subtract the time 10 ten you get 51 fifty one which is the sum for the English word \"Thor\"; and if you add the time 10 ten you get 71 seventy one which is the sum for the English words \"Zeus\", \"spirit\" and \"Temple\". If you take the sum of the neighborhood of the event Frayser then you have 92 which is the sum of the word \"reasonable\".   In addition, my initials WHB equals 33 thirty three and the English word AMEN equals 33 thirty three which is also associated with Jesus\\' crucifixion date (33 AD).  I am also 1/64 Native American (Cherokee).  ! Lastly the event was seen on a street called \"Leweir\" which d! ecoded t o 72 seventy two and it is also the decoded sum of the English words \"monks\" and \"world\". If you add the time 10 ten to 72 seventy two, you get 82 eighty two which is the decoded sum of the English words \"forgive\", \"Eastern\", and \"saints\".  If you subtract 10 ten from 72 seventy two then you get 62 sixth two which decodes to the English words \"gives\", and \"Think\".  These religious words decoded from my birth year and name may be factors in understanding why I was chosen to view the event and evolved into an UFO Prophet, Ambassador and Messenger of God.   Why was the city of Memphis chosen in 1964?    Several highways enter Memphis with interesting meanings and if you take the number, add or subtract the time of the event 10 PM to the highway number and match with the sum of words. Highway 64 and the event occurred in 1964 plus 64 decodes to the English words \"Mercy, Israel, focus, attend, never, and Zion\"; If you add 10 to 64 you get 74 for the words \"Messiah\", \"objects\", \"abortion\", and \"Jesus\";  If you subtract the event time 10 from 64 you get 54 which decodes to \"Islam\", \"those\", \"Gabriel\", \"right\", and \"Love\"; Highway 51 which like Area 51 can be suggestive of UFOs and 51 decodes the words \"Michael\", \"Indian\", \"saved\", \"Fatima\", \"avoid\", \"preach\", \"more\", \"Great\", \"Dixie\", and \"Catawba\"; If you subtract the event time 10 from 51 then you get 41 which decodes to \"good\", \"fun\", \"gone\", and \"King\"; Interstate I-40 which 40 decodes the word \"Buddha\" suggesting peace and harmony and the words \"Holy\", \"asked\", \"seek\", \"harm\",! and \"Maya\"; If you subtract the event time 10 from 40 you get 30 which decodes to \"Peace\", \"Bible\", and \"due\";  Highway 70 and decodes to the English words \"Yahweh\", \"honor\", and \"Cherokee\"; If you add 10 to 70 then you get 80 which decodes to \"Throne\", \"Creator\", \"values\", \"your\", \"miracles\", \"wildlife\", and \"religion\";  If you subtract 10 ten from 70 seventy you get 60 sixty that decode the words \"over\", \"mislead\", and \"believe\". Highway 57 and decodes to the English words \"Bless, Mary, Birth, City, Jews, Human\", and \"Moon\"; If you subtract 10 from 57 you get 47 which decodes to \"Beast, Radio, Judge, obey, Isaiah, John, and Osage\"; Interstate 55 and decodes to the English words \"Heaven\", \"Aztec\",  \"show\", \"part\", \"sky\", and \"Satan\"; If you add 10 to 55 you get 65 which decodes to \"Seven\"; Subtract 10 ten from 55 you get 45 which decode the words \"say\", \"Daniel\", and \"East\"; Highway 72 and decodes to the street where the event was witnessed \"Leweir\" and the English words ! \"Judging\" and \"World\"; If you subtract 10 from 72 you get 62 w! hich dec odes to \"Think\", \"first\", \"Comanche\", and \"tribal\"; If you add 10 to 72 you get 82 for the word \"forgive\";  Highway 61 and  decodes to the words \"Church\", \"Roman\", \"sins\", \"coming\", \"homes\", \"UFOs\", \"Yankee\", and \"Navaho\"; If you add 10 to 61 you get 71 which decodes to \"Catholic\", \"forget\", \"Moses\", \"advocate\", \"native\", and \"Pueblo\";  Highway 14 and 14 decodes to the English word \"Dead\"; Highway 79 and decodes to the English words \"Nature\", \"should\", \"words\", \"your\", \"honored\", \"elaborate\", \"Cheyenne\", and \"Quapaw\";  If you add 10 to 79 you get 89 for the sum of the words \"hunting\", and \"honors\"; If you subtract 10 from 79 you get 69 for the words \"Jeremiah\" and \"enjoy\"; Highway 78 and decodes to the name of the Native Indian tribe of Memphis region, the \"Chickasaw\" and the words \"repent\", and \"enjoyed\"; If you add 10 to 78 you get 88 which decodes to \"Woodland\", \"Sikhism\", \"peoples\", \"nothing\", and \"Ghosts\"; Highway 86 which decodes the words \"Mounds\", \"insight\", \"waters\"! , and \"souls\". If you add 10 to 86 you get 96 for the word \"opposes\".  These are most of the highways in Memphis and may be important clues relating to the \"Moon of Memphis\" UFO event.  The \"Moon of Memphis\" also represents the Great Spirit of the Chickasaw, Cherokee, Quapaw, Navaho, Catawba, Mounds, Osage, Pueblo, Woodland, Cheyenne, Comanche, Maya, Aztec, and other tribal Indian peoples.  Using many of the words decoded, this is a possible message:  To the peoples of the world, I William of the Divine God, the Holy Spirit, the Great Spirit, and the Good Creator greets you with this message and Fatima. The 1964 \"Moon of Memphis\" honors the Messiah Jesus Christ, the Savior in Spirit and the Virgin Mary, the Holy Mother.  Jehovah and Yahweh of the Jewish people of Israel and Zion gives thanks to Joseph, Mary, Jesus, the birth city of the Savior\\'s spirit, the Cross, and Jerusalem. The  peoples of religion of Christ, Judaism, Islam, Taoism, Sikhism,  Hinduism, Buddha, the Great Spirit and more should show love, peace, honor, and charity as asked from your Good Creator of the \"Moon of Memphis\",  over America.   Also say a prayer, bless, and show mercy to animals; plus enjoy and forgive children . Trees and nature should also be enjoyed and respected.  Avoid the beast and harm nothing; if you do harm, be prepared to elaborate to a spirit.    Always love the message of Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Daniel, and Isaiah; plus the story of Mo! ses and of Elisha.  Obey the God and power of the \"Moon of Memphis\", which can think and radio to humans,  and is our Savior in Spirit.  Messiah Jesus Christ, the King on his thrown, is helped by those who preach, believe, and convert in the East, West, and South; by those who attend or lead a Bible Church, the Eastern Church, a Catholic Church or the Roman Catholic Church; and due to the work of saints, Saint Gabriel, and the Archangel Saint Michael.   Beware of Satan and in Heaven we are judging the living and the dead.  First repent of your sins, then the Jesus the Christ, your advocate, will forgive you,  forget your sins, and try to heal you.  Preach the gospel and seek insight on the Bible.  Focus on and believe in the words and values of the Messiah Jesus Christ. Saint John of Patmos was mislead; Jesus Christ, the Messiah and a part of God, was never gone so this is a gentle second coming.  UFOs are miracles of God. Abortion is wrong but birth control is right.  God ! opposes hunting wildlife for fun.  Monks should agitate huntin! g.  Use at least forty percent of your nation for native nature and wildlife.  The souls and ghosts of the living and the dead of animals, humans, homes, buildings, objects, lands, sky, waters, and trees of good or reasonable character of this world, respected by the Great Spirit, the Holy Spirit, and the Good Creator of the \"Moon of Memphis\" of 11-22-1964, are hereby honored, redeemed, and saved by your Divine God.  The “Moon of Memphis” was possibly the same object as the “Star of Bethlehem” but at a much lower altitude. The Book of Mormon states that a bright light appeared in the sky over Bethlehem. Was this the Star of Bethlehem at a much lower altitude like the “Moon of Memphis”? The “Moon of Memphis” ascended and appeared as a bright star until it ascended out of sight. The symbol of Islam is the moon and star. Was the “Moon of Memphis” trying to send a meaning to Islamic believers? At high altitude it appeared like a bright star reminding me of the “Star of David” or the “Star of Bethlehem”. It seems that the “Moon of Memphis” was trying to relay meaning to all of the religions of Zion; Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.  The \"Moon of Memphis\" may also be trying to connect with those who believe in the Wicca religion or those who worship the Great Spirit in Native American religions, and Indian religions.  The rising to space of the Holy and white circular \"Moon of Memphis\", symbo! lically suggest the body of Christ being taken by God to the heavens as a communion act and evidence of Jesus Christ being accepted as a Lord and Savior of Earth.  If you see the communion wafer used by the catholic church, then you can imagine what the Holy \"Moon of Memphis\" looked like in the sky.  This event also suggest that the \"Star of Bethlehem\" appeared as a very bright star from a distance but appeared as a full white moon to the people directly under it giving a moon-like light to the community below and baptizing the people with the Holy light of God.  Was the “Moon of Memphis” a sign to tell the believers of all religions that they have a common God who is known by many names? Was it a sign of peace or the return of the messiah? Much change in the human condition have occurred since 1964 suggesting that it meant both a sign of the living God and his commitment to the earth to improve the world. Was the appearance over Memphis, Tennessee (USA) a sign that God has chosen that city as the New Jerusalem mentioned in Revelations of the Bible? This city may very well be a gateway to heaven. Something to think about if you really want your prayers heard. It might be a city worthy of a pilgrimage.  The message analyzed from this event seem to suggest that the event symbolized a common God of all religions, peoples, and life.  The “Moon of Memphis” is a sign, the lamb of God, of the return of the Messiah for it is written:  Revelation 21:23 “The city had no need of the sun or of the moon to shine in it, for the glory of God illuminated it. The Lamb is its light.  Revelation 22:5; “There shall be no night there: They need no lamp nor light of the sun, for “the Lord God gives them light” And they shall reign forever and ever.  With the “Moon of Memphis”, the New Jerusalem will be made and with its power, the people will have light. This Holy city may not come about anytime soon according to scriptures, but the “Moon of Memphis” is proof that God can make good his promise to bless this new city with heavenly light not from the sun or the moon. Since the “Moon of Memphis” appeared over Memphis, Tennessee (USA) in 1964, it is possible that this city is similar to the New Jerusalem, an important city of God. The “Moon of Memphis” proved in 1964 to produce light as bright as the moon and I suspect that it could produce a much brighter light if it had to. It is a commitment to the earth to always be with us during good times and bad times. The “Moon of Memphis” is the lamb of God and also the Holy Grail or Holy light of Christ. Celebrate and be exceedingly joyous of the truth and existence of the “Moon of Memphis”.  As a seven year old boy, I was baptized by the light of the lamb, the Holy light of God.  In the Bible, Luke 24:51, “Now it came to pass, while He blessed them, that He was parted from them and carried up into heaven.”  This was the Ascension of Jesus and a phenomenon that I want to discuss. It is my assertion that Jesus went into something like the “Moon of Memphis” of 1964. The “Star of Bethlehem” which was similar to the “Moon of Memphis” had to of descended to a low altitude to be carried up into heaven. Though nothing was mention of a craft, the event suggests that such a event had to have happen for this to be true. As a witness the “Moon of Memphis”, I believe that the “Star of Bethlehem” was the same object as the “Moon of Memphis” and it actually took Jesus aboard so Jesus could establish his church and religion from celestial assistance. The success of the religion also suggest that a higher power and probably from what we now call UFO assisted Jesus as God in his mission. If this is what occurred then it would also suggest that the “Moon of Memphis” was the second coming of Jesus in the spirit. I believe that the Messiah,  Jesus Christ, returned to the earth in 1964 and we are li! ving in a new age of life.  God chose one individual to witness the return of the Messiah.  Jesus said in Matthew 5:8 \"Blessed are the pure in heart:  for they shall see God\".  Maybe the Spirit of Jesus of the \"Moon of Memphis\" felt that I was pure in heart as a seven year old boy.  Like the first visit to earth, the messiah chose a simple humble and meek way to make his return known. Also, the Messiah, Jesus Christ, had the privacy to work with humanity to make it more peaceful and comfortable. Most would have expected a more visible and public return but that would also cause many to resist change and expect instant success. God chose a seven year old boy to show his presence and return and much change has occurred over the past few decades. Glory to God and we welcome the return of the Messiah, Jesus Christ, who returned in the \"Moon of Memphis\" in the spirit to be a partner to humanity and all life to make the world better. Amen.  The historic battle of Armageddon was probably the famous Six Day War of Israel in 1967.  This war fulfilled prophesy and it occurred just several years after the return of Jesus Christ\\'s spirit, the Messiah, and other new Messiahs that came in the \"Moon of Memphis\" event.  Apparently Jesus knew that with the turmoil in the world and Middle East, He and other Spirits of God had to appeared or return to work with this earth to make it more peaceful.  The Cold War with the Soviet Union and China were also very serious concerns to God.  Many prayed to God and Jesus to help and their prayers were answered with the \"Moon of Memphis\" appearance and influence.  Maybe prophesy of gloom were indicators when Godly influence was necessary to help humanity.  Maybe every generation in need get their own second coming of Jesus or appearance and influence of God.  For this generation the 1964 appearance of the \"Moon of Memphis\" was our second coming of Jesus and coming of new generations o! f Spirits of God made from collected spirits from the best of God\\'s creation and the best of humanity.  In the New Testament book of Revelations from the Bible, John of Patmos may have been mislead because of his association of disasters and end of the world in association with the return of the Messiah, Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ had a good character and kind personality and his return has created a world that is more in tune with him as a Messiah and a Savior.  To believe that Jesus has not returned or has ever left the world is to believe that Jesus Christ is not a part of God.  The Divine God of many names and those who believe that Jesus Christ was gone did not fully understand his Divinity and constant presence on this earth both in word from the Gospels and in the Spirit as God.  The \"Moon of Memphis\" event is proof that God and Jesus Christ in Spirit is here on this earth and the true antichrists would make you believe that Jesus as a part of God was ever gone to begin with.  This is why John of Patmos vision may be a seed of Satan designed to make you fear Jesus Chris! t as a part of God or wish the end of this beautiful world.  God with Jesus Christ as the Son of God, known by other names in various religions, have worked hard to make this world better.   Do not be so vain as to think that humanity did it all alone without God.   We see the understanding and appreciation between nations and cultures; we see many nations dedicated to preserving peace and cooperation; we see much charity from many nations to other nations; we see animals receiving preserves and protection; we see kinder view of other religions; we see advancement in construction, science and technology; we see the human race living more comfortable and entertained; we see cooperation between nations to prevent and resolve issues of war;  we see remarkable improvement in medicine and health;  we see racial and sexual equality; and we see the advancement of food production. These are but a few of the many things that also truly mark the return of the Messiah for Christians and coming of the Messiah for other religions. A true sign of G! od, the \"Moon of Memphis\" is a sign that a kind God is with us and dedicated to all things living. Do not follow prophets of gloom, but understand that disasters are natural phenomenon that can not easily be predicted but we can overcome the trauma with our faith in a kind God and Messiah. The best of your religion will not fail you if you try to be kind in every way and not lose reverence to our kind lord, our God.  Since I was fortunate enough to witness the appearance of the light of the lamb, the \"Moon of Memphis\",  God and Jesus Christ love the world so much but understand the need for some to have the Revelations prophesy of John of Patmos fulfilled so the prophesy was completely fulfilled within the mind of me, William of God.  Within my mind was a world or earth that the spirits had made and everything that Revelations said would happen, did indeed happened according to scripture and prophesy.  I read Revelations in the New Testament and some of the events were in the physical world like visiting Whitehorse, Yukon twice without understanding the scripture significance of the White Horse.  Other event occurred with spirit visions in my mind that I could see and monitor.  This completed the Second Coming events of Revelations and allowed God and Christ to work with the world and earth of those who had not witnessed the Second Coming event of Jesus to use character, logic, reason, a! nd grace to help humanity to improve the world and work to make a heaven on earth for as many people and earthlings as possible.  The activities of God and Christ continues to this very day working with the spirits and humanity to make a peaceful and wonderful world for all life both physical and spiritual.  Minutes after this paragraph was added to this article, I heard a loud boom and power was cut from my residence and neighborhood at 1507 or 3:07 PM this clear sky Friday 18 November 2011.  By using his power to affect the transformer, God is saying that he is powerful and a transformer of life.  In 1990 at age 33 thirty three,  I was traveling to Washington, D.C. to my next assignment at USCG Headquarters.  I was on a highway from Florida north to Washington D.C. when I decided to say a prayer to God to help me on my next assignment.  At the moment that I said \"AMEN\", something happened.  My fingers were froze in the extended position and I went blind for almost my total vision. I could see just a little through a small tunnel and the rest of my vision was red.  It was just enough vision to get off the expressway where I stomped the brakes and waited fifteen minutes for my vision to return and my fingers to return to normal.  The phenomenon could have been a strike of lightening or it could have been just a mind phenomenon but when my vision and movement of my fingers became normal I was able to hear the voices of angels.  At age 33 thirty three the spirits of the Lord started to speak with me after being blinded for fifteen minutes after a prayer to God. The spirit gave revelations to me and in 1997, 33 thirty three years after the event,  a color vision of \"Jesus Christ\" appeared to me. Jesus talk many days with me about life on the earth and problems that exists with all of God creations.  Christ basically said God wanted humanity to be more reverent to all living beings and animals. The consciousness of each being or animal is precious and must be respected more. Before animals are killed, they should receive anesthesia and be put into a deep sleep. Anything less is cruel, heartless, and disrespectful  to animal rights and  to God.  Humanity should find a way to eat without killing animals, but until then, we must not kill an animal while it is awake. Treat innocent animals as you would like to be treated if you were in their place.  Many species of animals have a covenant with God that if! they are well protected and allowed to become numerous with the help of humanity,  then they will give their life when required to help humanity and earn a right to live in the heavens made for them.  At times some species are favored over humanity to help them, protect them, and increase their numbers.   If you put a human brain the form of most animals they would probably act as the do now.  To have dominion over other living creatures or animals requires that you treat them as you would like to be treated and that should be with kindness and mercy to avoid God\\'s judgment or wrath against you.   The \"Moon of Memphis\" is proof that God does exist and we should obey Christ\\'s message for us to be more kind to each living being and animals.  Each species of animals have their own lifespan which also dictate the time necessary for the young to be raised.  During their lives they have challeges that require much intellect.  The challenges of finding food, of social behavior, of mating, and of parenting their young.  Many species show much success, devotion, and intellect compared to many humans that exist in this world.  Though they have a smaller brain, they seem capable of showing human-like intellect.  This is because they have a God that assist them like humans or they somehow have human spirits in their minds.  God must create mind waves that help animals in a similar manner as God helps humans.  Because they have a God influenced mind from everything that exist, they must be revered more.  Human bigotry against animals is a form of prejudice that causes many humans to be heartless against them and for other humans as well.  If God shares it\\'s mind with other forms of life, then do you think that God respects! those who seem to be insensitive, heartless, or cruel to other God influenced life.  An animal with a shorter life span probably values it\\'s short life even more than humans.  It\\'s life is precious and many religions totally ignore the santity of life of other earthlings to the point that they disrespect and get cursed by their God that suffers in these other harmed earthlings.  Those that connect true character with the respect and reverence of every form of life will be blessed, those with careless prejudice engrained through culture and religion will find their lives afflicted with pain and sorrow.  Nature is not dead in the mind but a very conscious and active God-like mind that will make life and death decisions based on the management of the various species.  Will the grim reaper think that you as an overpopulated human a kind credit to earth and it\\'s many species or will you have to be weeded out with bad luck, disease, or spiritually warfare because of your heartle! ss closed mind to other living kinds of life.  If you neglect ! to learn from this article, then you many suffer a fate with a delusion that God doesn\\'t truely exist and then suffer the consequences of nature.  If you are wise then you will learn that everything that exist is alive in its own frequencies and probable have a human or God like intellect that must be respected which includes each species of animals, trees, structures, lands, and even sky.  Jesus\\' birth in a wooden manger full of animals represents the specialness that Jesus\\' mind and nature had in common with the other special creatures of the earth; the animals and the trees.  His mission of salvation was meant for all things and life of the Earth and God.  He died to show us what was happening to the animals and trees who were very alive and needed humanity\\'s love and understanding.  They needed help, respect, and salvation.  True salvation comes from understanding what God and Jesus was trying to tell humanity and only by kindness, respect, love, and avoiding harming these creations and life can God and even Satan give you peace.  Through the Christ power, the mind and spirit of trees, land, waters, and good animals have God\\'s power and dominion over humanity and lesser spirits and lords to protect and preserve nature and require mercy and spiritual equality with humanity.  Jesus\\' suffering, death, and resurrection helped Jesus Christ to experience and unde! rstand what all life that is sacrificed and harmed experienced thus helping him as Lord and God to minister to the life that suffers and to strengthen his resolve to protect better and defend the life of animals, trees, humans, or spirits.  To avoid curses, retribution, and suffering, you must not harm anything because any harm has a price upon humanity and yourselves.  Those with a true love for Jesus and those he represent will find forgiveness and salvation; however, as he once stated, \"what you do to the least of mine people, you have done unto me\".  The manager full of animals and wood of trees with Jesus born to their witness reflect the people of Christ needing salvation and appreciation.  The enemies of the living things and creatures of earth; humanity and their spirits, also needed salvation for their sins against others that they harmed for their needs. Jesus showed the peoples of Christ how to face death, forgive those who harmed and killed you, and the miracle ! of resurrection by God that will be given to those good beings! who are sacrificed by God and humanity.  The Communion is remembering and honoring not only Jesus Christ but all life that is sacrificed for humanity and God\\'s will for this world.  God wants people to be at peace with those who worship God in other religions. If a person or nation is reasonably kind regardless of their understanding of Allah or God, you should be friends with them. Do not war or jihad against reasonably kind and friendly individuals or nations. Work within yourself to be kinder and a better example of kindness to others and to animals. God’s character of kindness is true so do not follow those who urge you to harm or terrorize. God blesses any belief, religion, or culture that teaches kindness to others and to animals. Those who are mean spirited and cruel are not blessed by God and do not be deceived or lead by such individuals or organizations.  God believes that he has been fair in sharing the lands of Israel and Palestine. He believes that the followers of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam are the chosen people or Jews. Each is a religious belief of Jews of Allah or God with Holy books to learn of Allah\\'s or God\\'s will for you. Since Christians and Muslims are also Jews, Allah or God have allowed the religious and peaceful individuals access to these Holy Lands. Anyone near the Holy Lands of Israel or Palestine who is not a kind peaceful person will be cursed by God or Allah for violation of the peace and good will that God commands for all the Jews - the Bible Jews, the Koran Jews, and the Torah Jews.  God kept his promise to give the lands of Canaan to the Jews and he has done precisely that.  The Lord God asked Noah of the Bible and Torah to take care of wildlife.  The spirits of the Lord of the \"Moon of Memphis\" wants you to also help animals and plants and give land back to wildlife.  If you own a large section of land then give at least 40 percent to the wildlife.  Forty was chosen because it would create refuges all over the country side for the wildlife and plants to flourish and survive.  The word \"Buddha\" equals 40 and he would say 40 percent would make the most peace and harmony.  Forty is also associated with Jewish and Christian religions.   If you own small parcels of land then serious consideration should be given to allow the land go wild.  You can even plant some fruit and nut trees to help feed the wildlife.  If the animal has wings, then they must be Angels of Nature.  If you have a city or town lot and home, then try to feed the birds or angels to receive a special blessing from the Lord.  Your offering to the creatures of God in the form of food! and land will ease your spirit and soften your heart to all matters concerning life.  Your health will improve and you will receive blessings from God and you will help make amends for the sins that you want forgiven.  Many human illnesses, war, sin, and crime are caused when the spirits and God of land, fields, waters, trees, and animals war against humanity for cruel conduct against them.   Wildlife enjoy their life of freedom and it is possible for your spirit to be put into wildlife as a form of heaven for those who appreciate living free with nature.  Others may be required to live in animals minds that you harm to evolve your spirit to respect life more.  Many wild animals eat poisonous plants including agricultural plants with herbicides and pesticides, and have viruses that can contaminate your home so eating wild animals can cause you to have toxins and little known diseases that can cause shorter life spans.  Many small animals that rarely cause a problem to humanity or habitat should be protected like songbirds and never be hunted or killed by humanity. Natural predators other than humans should be allowed to affect them.  The wildlife covenant with God is to accept  a merciful ! move or possible death by God or humanity, when their numbers become too many and causing  significant harm to humanity or habitat, rather than a slower death by predators.    God tries to preserve their soul,  grant them land to live, and give their spirits good safe heavens such as in the minds of comfortable humans, other animals, land, trees, or sky.  What humans do to other earthlings will affect what the God mind in any geographic area does to humanity.  Hunters each year go to the wildlife areas to commit massacres of tribes of earthlings and cause their spirits to legitimately war on humans.  They can cause all kinds of mental and physical illnesses due to the trouble that hunters cause.  If you think that hunters have a God given right to murder other earthlings without retribution, then you are seriously wrong.  You should show God that you are reverent to all that God has made such as birds, animals, trees, and plants.  God will respect you more and love you mor! e if you can help the Lord take care of the other creations of! life.  The Bible, the New Testament, and the Koran speaks of phenomenon occurring when a tree is bothered.  The scriptures suggest voices and wrath could occur when trees are harmed.  The spirits of the \"Moon of Memphis\" suggest that since there is much electricity in a tree, it is possible for trees to think, dream or possess a form of consciousness recognized by God.  Trees may be a plant animal so be careful when harming a tree.  If it has nerves then winter is the season to prune them so they will not feel pain and curse you.  Cutting a tree at night may cause less pain since their consciousness are possibly stimulated by sunlight.  If you must cut wood then use the wood in a structure so the weight of the wood can reorganize into a acceptable consciousness and thus you will be cursed less.  Pray for your trees and pray about cutting them and if you feel it is wrong then don\\'t cut them or harm them.  Show reverence to trees and save yourselves.  The parents who have children must apply kindness and justice to their discipline of children.  Never beat, hit or  whip a child just because they get on your nerves.  Harsh punishment and training should be reserved for the most malicious, cruel, or mean conduct. Evil conduct is dealt with more sternly than nerve troublesome conduct and honest mistakes should be dealt with a understanding, kind response. Do not be cruel to your children or you will be surely be cursed and many phenomenon of health could occur to you for cruelty.  Do not forget that as you want the Lord to forgive and give mercy to you, when a sorrowful child cries out for forgiveness and mercy, you represent the Lord and should not let your temper ignore your heart of kindness.  The spirits of God, Christ, and Allah the “Moon of Memphis” say that most rebellion and crime in most nations is the result of government failure to fulfill its role to its peoples. This can be discrimination against some segment of the population such as minorities or peoples with mental and physical disabilities.  In the more modern nations, minorities have rebelled and sued the government for equal rights and opportunities. Presently in most of the countries of the world the disabled have difficulty getting help in a timely manner. Disabled people, those with low learning abilities and mental disorders plus those with physical disabilities have been forced to suffer or forced to engage the sale of drugs and prostitution to sustain themselves to survive when the neglected by government and uncaring majorities. Government has a duty to provide the disable with a healthy pension or job so they can live a normal life and live a peaceful life free of crime and rebellion. The i! mprisonment of the disabled in most world countries by naïve and uncaring governments constitutes a gross civil rights abuse and cruelty. It is a violation against the duties of government and God to neglect and abuse the disabled and those who continues to ignore the disabled and abused them will be cursed by God and they will suffer mental and physical illnesses and bad luck from the spirits of God, Christ, or Allah.  In your memory of people you know, your mind makes spirits patterned after them. Sometime these spirits are loyal to the person they are patterned after. If you talk bad about a person then that person\\'s spirit sometimes work against you by giving you bad subconscious advice and emotions and may be able to affect your mental and physical health. If you behave poorly, they may turn against you because you have lost their respect and love. If you keep bad friends then these poor or bad spirits may behave like your friends, saying things in your mind subconsciously to cause you to make poor decisions and make trouble for other people. You must not gossip or talk bad about others, especially against those you know closely and you must not get to know bad character individuals if you are weak in moral or law abiding behaviors. From watching television, you can even create spirits of people in the media or government. These spirits represent society and if you don\\'t act right, the! y too can turn against you and make you ill. Everyone\\'s mind makes spirits but most of the spirits influence the subconscious mind. Some people are disabled because they hear these same spirits in their conscious mind and sometimes they learn how to make changes in their lives and get along with them. Spirits are a fact of life but the Spirits of God are made from the \"Moon of Memphis\", the Earth, and from spirits that are especially good and kind; often influenced by religious texts of kind religions.  The spirits of Earth and sky can communicate with the spirits of your mind to influence your mind and body for various reasons and can create structured realities to affect you in usual positive ways but occasionally to bring you bad luck for something you have intentionally or accidentally harmed on this Earth.   The spirits of the land, trees, animals, humans, and sky can collect in the sky and make a glowing UFO that can be many acres in size and create light. Like phenomenon of dreams created from smaller size spirit matter in the brains of animals, in the UFOs, they can hover in space above a city or country and produce radio that is of good quality and very similar to human made radio. This is why some of the music and radio messages seem to be talking to what is on your mind because the spirits inside your head receive the signals also and guide your thoughts. These thoughts are designed to make you kinder, understanding of others, and forgiving to make you better and help you overcome negative thoughts planted from less honorable information given to you by other humans or human spirits and media sometimes behaving as the devil or Satan who may want you to be prejudice against others or act in a way that could cause you to harm others or become harmed. Listen for the kind thou! ghts and kind messages from God\\'s UFO radio in words or music and receive security and wisdom from God.  This information is derived from analyzing the \"Moon of Memphis\" UFO phenomenon and radio phenomenon associated with God\\'s spirits and voice phenomenon. Since the UFO produces light, there is no logical reason that would prevent it from producing radio and my personal experience strongly suggest that this capability exist.   The God of the \"Moon of Memphis\" would like the youth and adults to focus on character traits to improve themselves as citizens of this world.  The international scouting organization have focused on twelve traits and have lead this living witness to learn and live by them.  They are trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean and reverent.  Your religious leaders, parents, community leaders and teachers may have other good character traits that you should also focus on to improve yourselves and be a honorable citizen of your community and God.  As Will-i-am of God,  a son of forests, fields, deserts, tundra, waters, land, sky, and cities,  I have asked the good Spirits of God of the \"Moon of Memphis\" to save the people of this world with good character and kindness to all earthlings.  They include the animals of Nature, food animals, trees, objects, structures, land, waters, sky, humans, spirits, God, and other forms of life.  These Spirits of God of the \"Moon of Memphis\" said that they would save them and try to bless them.  They ask the saved to help other people to develop good character and kindness to all earthlings so they too may be saved by the God of all kind religions, the God of the \"Moon of Memphis\" that appeared in 1964 to this honest living witness.  The God of the \"Moon of Memphis\" chose a boy named William to appear to because his name means \"protector of the weak and innocent\" and God of the \"Moon of Memphis\" also tries to protect the weak and innocent. The good spirits of the \"Moon of Memphis\" hav! e the power to save.  Jesus Christ is one of the good Spirits of God of the \"Moon of Memphis\" who also saves. In Matthew 5 of the New Testament of the Bible he says:   3aBlessed are the bpoor in spirit: for theirs is the ckingdom of heaven. 4Blessed are they that amourn: for they shall be bcomforted. 5Blessed are the ameek: for they shall inherit the bearth. 6Blessed are they which do ahunger and thirst after brighteousness: for they shall be filled. 7Blessed are the amerciful: for they shall obtain mercy. 8Blessed are the apure in bheart: for they shall csee God. 9Blessed are the apeacemakers: for they shall be called the bchildren of God. 10Blessed are they which are apersecuted for brighteousness’ sake: for ctheirs is the kingdom of heaven.    These verses show, for example,  some categories of people that the Spirit of Jesus of the \"Moon of Memphis\"  saves regardless of their beliefs or religion as long as they have learned to be good and kind.  The Spirit of Jesus of the \"Moon of Memphis\" appreciates the groups and churches that teaches his ministry and lessons devoted to character and to God.    God of the \"Moon of Memphis\" is not responsible for many natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornados, floods, droughts, and earthquakes. God is also not responsible for accidents and acts of violence but God can help you a little and maybe that will be enough to protect you most of the time.   You are loved by the Lord, our God, and God is dedicated to recreating many of the dead and injured by these disasters, accidents, and violence.  Do not be demoralized by them for the Lord cares about you and want you to not be harmed.  We may sense reasons for the disasters because there are many sinners in the communities but God prefers to work with sinners on an individual manner and chooses not to use disasters to harm a few individuals at the expense of the many.  God prefers and is limited sometimes to helping you by affecting your thinking so listen up to your conscious and subconscious mind for good advice to improve your safety and security. In addition, God of the \"Moon o! f Memphis\" uses its spirits to organize society to create schools, religion, industry, science, and government systems to improve society\\'s behavior thus creating as many decent well behaved and helped citizens as possible to minimize suffering, dangers, and crime.  The spirits of the “Moon of Memphis” have moved me to comment on various topics. God wants you to pray to the Lord about your problems and hopefully, these comments will start you in that direction.  God  please help the hungry. If you are hungry and suffer, God will take away your pain in time. Those that feed the hungry will be blessed for their kindness.  Do not do evil while you suffer and the Lord will recreate you in better times if you stay honorable and endure faithfully.  God please bless the poor and improve their condition. If you are poor, do not do evil to sustain yourselves. God will try to improve your community if you live honorably and try to improve yourselves. If you die poor, God will try to remake you in more successful families so do not give up hope because this lifespan will one day end and you will get a new beginning.  God please heal the mentally ill. The Lord knows that you are suffering and do not give up on life. It may take a while for the Lord to help you but he is searching for people like you. If you perish, God will give you a new mind in your next life on this earth.  God please heal the physically ill. God will try to heal you with doctors and religious people. You may try to prepare yourself for you disability or death by being kind in every way imaginable. End the conflicts in your life and mind and know that you will one day inherit a new body and spirit.  God please help the lonely.  May your God open your mind and speak to you.  Avoid finding fault in others and be helpful to others and you will find friendship and love.  Do not give up your life to evil and harmful conduct and the Lord will bless you and you will not be lonely for a long time.  Try to improve your heart and character so others will like you better.  God please help the desperate men and women.   May you find each other to help each other with love and gifts of love to sustain you.  If you cannot find work then with your consciousness and God as your guide, try helping each other without being cruel and heartless. Be honest and honorable to those who befriend you to help you.  Do not have contempt in your hearts to others and they will sense your kindness and will help you with your needs.  God please bless the elderly and widows.  You are special people weakened by age and the loss of your love ones and friends.  Those that help you with friendship and love will also be blessed with God\\'s friendship and love.  Make peace with your family and receive their considerate love and care.  God will one day welcome you to new dimensions of life so you must prepare by being full of grace and kindness.  God please stop the evil sinners. If you are a evil sinner then your fate cannot improve unless you immediately repent and follow a better behaved spirit. You will have much bad luck until you change to a kind decent individual. You cannot have peace in your mind until you change. If you are captured and imprisoned, then know that the Lord will work with you to help your bear your punishment honorably. If you must die for your sins and crimes, the Lord will try to help you live again in better circumstances so that honorable life will be easier to live.  God please help me to deal with enemies.  To love your enemy you must try to understand their culture, mind, and perspectives. From this understanding you can try to reconcile your differences with them. Examine yourself to see whether or not you are a good being or people. Correct your own culture, mind, and perspectives before acting against others or for God. War with your enemy only to defend yourselves and help God to stop their evil against yourself and others. If your enemy is generally good, kind, and honorable then lend yourself to their influence and love your enemy.  God please bless the dead. Do not grieve excessively for the dead for they are in God hands and they will be dealt with in a fair manner. The weak will be strengthened and the righteous will be rewarded. Others will be remade on this earth in better times and conditions. Rejoice to the wisdom and fairness of God.  God thank you for the blessed. If your life is good then try to be an honorable example of kindness. Your luck is intentional so you can carry the spirits of the less fortunate in your minds. Many lives have hoped to live in the minds of the blessed so enjoy your life and remember others that you share reality with. Charity and kindness should be your passion.  The spirits of the “Moon of Memphis” stated that billions Messiahs will be born on the earth. Some have already been born and are now youth and adults. These Messiahs will be from all the nations, all kind religions, atheists, most animals, and spirits. They will have much character and kindness to all earthlings.  They will be both male and female and they will be Holy.  These Messiahs will be of religion, science, industry, government, military, parenting, business, medicine, entertainment, land management, food production, judiciary, construction, charity, and many other fields and occupations.  Look for these Messiahs for the Lord has returned to the Earth to rule and assist this world. You will know the Lord by many names but the fulfillment of prophecy will occur. This world was visited in 1964 with the “Moon of Memphis” a sign of the spirits of God, messiahs, and prophets. They do have the Christ or Messiah mind that they radio into the minds of the good and kind of t! his earth. The Holy light will be visible by those who are fortunate and the kind spirit will be heard by those who are blessed; and they will be living witnesses of the return and presence of the Lord, our God.  The Revelation from the Christ of the “Moon of Memphis” explains how we will live again on this earth. We never die on this God blessed planet because it has life and it has a soul. The soul is everything outside the body that influences the brain to recreate the mind of a human. That is geography, language, history, religion, culture and species. These external factors create the mind and consciousness and will recreate you after you die. You pop out of life when you die and you reenter life by the \"conscious creating soul\" within a short period of time. You will probably have amnesia of your past life but you will certainly have consciousness again. If you made the world better and safer in your past life then you will come alive again in a world that you help create.  When God is at rest or allowing the natural world to recreate you then you have the phenomenon that was mentioned in the previous paragraph. God can collect your spirit by setting off a radio in your brain when activated by signals from the \"Moon of Memphis\". This would probably occur day or night when the \"Moon of Memphis\" is high in the sky or space above. When hovering it would be hard to tell whether it\\'s the moon at low altitude or a star at high altitude.  When God wants you to be held accountable for your actions or if God wants to give special consideration to your spirit for it\\'s accomplishments then you may experience unique mind phenomenon. Your spirit collected can allow God to do things to you in your afterlife. Heaven and Hell are two places that your spirit can go. It is possible for God to put your spirit in other people or in animals to help you understand them and their plight. If you are insensitive to others then God may recreate you in beings that you care little about. It\\'s God\\'s justice and you sometimes must evolve through those you don\\'t care about. These might be animals that you harm or people that you cannot understand or help.  If you are a good influence then your spirit may be able to enter the minds of those you prefer.  Worship God, Christ, and the power of the \"Moon of Memphis\" and may God bless and have mercy on your spirit and soul.  Because animals have the goodness and kindness of nature, they should be never be harmed.  They have a lifestyle that humanity needs to respect and understand.  They must be allowed to roam the land without being molested or murdered.  God places the spirits of humanity often into animals as a heaven that some want or deserves.  If you grant the animals peace then your heaven will have peace but if you violate the heaven for animals by molesting their habitat and murdering them for fun and recreation then you will have to answer to God.   A good and kind heaven requires humanity to respect nature, the lands of nature, and the animals of nature, for the trees will be the pillars of your church called nature and in the minds of animals you will return to the garden of Eden, one type of heaven.  The UFO phenomenon may be the result of a natural intelligent life form that scientist have yet to understand and explain. I will offer one theory of how the UFO is formed and why they are of an intelligent life form associated to God.  I believe that there is a structured electro magnetic nuclear form that exist in space that absorbs light energy and it is a stable form made from light photons that no longer travel and other energy that no longer travel or move. It has a fabric or form that enables it to organize as a brain and store memory and information. It is an energy or spirit life form that collects and grows from light and energy. Over time, matter starts forming within it so it basically helps energy to reform into matter. It probably starts out is life span as a marble size intelligent life and grows into much larger size and eventually becomes meteors, comets, moons, planets, and stars. During it smaller youth size, it can enter there atmosphere and also enter to objects such as land, plants, animals, and clouds. Its can give consciousness to anything that it enters and in humans, it can cause people to hear voices of spirits and produce dreams. In trees, land, and clouds it also can produce int! elligence and phenomenon that is often associated with God.  These wisps of spirit energy beings can learn and affect other life in good or bad ways. These energy matter beings can also be religious or atheist in their outlook of themselves and humanity. They can come together, form large bodies of spirit energy matter beings, and form into impressive UFOs and start to glow from these collectives of spirit energy matter beings. Since they are intelligent, their collective can be organized into large multi-acre starships usually round in nature that can travel in the atmosphere or space. If they want to they can travel to other stars and disassemble and influence the mind of a planet and act as the God spirits to the life there. They could just find a star and grow to such a size to precipitate star energy into matter and form a planet. Other collectives can also in coordination with other collectives form into moons for the planet. This is how the spirit energy matter beings can influence reality and act as a conscious God to form pla! nets and UFOs.  If your mind has this type of spirit energy matter being in it, you probably are influencing it to create a spirit within it patterned after your consciousness and personality. If you die this being will probably leave your brain and carry your spirit to another location. It might take your spirit to a collective called heaven or maybe into a UFO or even choose to enter the brain of another person, animal, or other objects such as land, trees, or clouds. Great opportunities exist for those who are lucky enough to have one of these energy matter spirit beings in your brain.   If you want to signal the \"Moon of Memphis\", then put color lights on your front and back porch and color lights in your windows and light it every night for months and years. This will get God\\'s attention as you stand out in the night and you will probably notice more dream activity. I have displayed color lights at my house for several years and it really works. This will help you get your spirit collected without harming the flesh and provide more peace and security to your mind as your lights call out to God for attention, love, and help.   Messenger of God of the \"Moon of Memphis\" William H. Bickers Capt USAF O-3 / Lt USCG O-3 Retired  PS:  People will believe what they want to believe but this article is both true and honest.  Much of the contents of this article has been published by these internet newspapers :  Memphis FM; Tennessee Post; West Virginia Post; Alabama Post; Arkansas Post; Washington State Post;  White House News; Security Council News; Pentagon Post; Israel Post; Israel FM; Saudi Times; Gaza News; Palestine Post; Iran Republic; Vatican Post; Muslim Generation; NASA News; World Wide News; Slavic Times; and many more.  I hope you received a blessing from reading this article.  Notes about author: I have worshiped in many churches such as Baptist, Methodist, Lutheran, Episcopal, Pentecostal, Assembly of God, Anglican, Catholic, Presbyterian, Church of Christ, Church of God, Military, TV and Mormon churches.  I believe that worshiping with others help you overcome prejudices and become one with the body of believers.  I also believe that every kind religion is another testament of God and much can be also learned of God by studying other religions.  I have visited some other countries and lands over my life.  The places that I visited are:  United States, Canada, Mexico, England, Scotland, Spain, Guam, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and the Bahamas.  I learned that we are very much alike all over the world.   Please show this article to your friends, family, and religious leaders if you could be so kind.  Everyone deserves to know about the \"Moon of Memphis\", the appearance of the Messiah.  Other evidence of a God both outside of my mind and inside of my mind is a piece of land that I bought at age 19 which just happen to be 6.4 acres of land that I bought to give back to God by allowing it to go wild.  It is my little Israel or Zion on the floodplain of the Loosahatchie River bottoms near Firestone city park of Memphis in Frayser.  This river is 64 miles long by the way which may be another reason the  1964 \"Moon of Memphis\" appeared within a mile of that river.   Another instance was when I had to find a house to rent I was not very conscious of its number significance until years later when I wrote this article.  My address was on a street in Frayser neighborhood of Memphis called Adair Street.  \"Adair\" has a numeric sum of 33 thirty three and the block was also 33 thirty three.  My initials equals 33 and I started to hear voices of spirits at age 33.  These two examples show evidence of a God in the community working structured realities with the cooperatio! n with the spirit of God inside my head.'],\n",

At first glance though it was a shooting star, then a comet, then jet exhaust that realized none of those.  I could not determine the height due to the unlit area matched the dark sky, it looked like it was in space.  Looking at arm's length about three feet long (very large) and an inch wide.  The object I saw was just dots of white lights like stars.  More in the front area thinning to the middle, one light ¾ to the end and one light trailing at the end.  All the lights where moving at the same speed heading west to east.  The speed seemed to be about the same as a commercial jet at cruising altitude.  None of these lights where blinking, they were all steady and there was no sound. ((NUFORC Note:  Starlink satellites, launched by Space X on May 23rd.  PD))\",\n",

       "       'Missing Time: Two People My mother and I have a long history of UFO sightings/involvement.  It\\'s highly possible that there was an abduction experience when I was not quite three, and my mother was 23, involving not only us but a busload of soldiers en route to Augusta, GA, in 1957.  But when the incident I\\'m reporting now happened, I was around 25, and my mother was 45.  I had driven from my suburban Alexandria home to visit my mother in Front Royal, VA, and we decided it was a lovely summer afternoon for a drive.  We went on one of our old favorite rides: to a nearby mountain where an airliner had crashed a number of years before, just up the road from a semisecret military installation.  The road led through some beautiful countryside, and we\\'d always enjoyed taking leisurely drives and talking about life in general.  My mother and I had seen many UFOs, both together and separately, and had, as mentioned earlier, a bizarre bus trip when I was very young, but on this summer day the conversation was light, and the subject matter was strictly terrestrial... except, of course, for our traditional speculation on what went on at that semisecret military complex out in the boondocks yet so close to DC.  We were travelling north in bright sunlight early in the afternoon... then the next thing we remember, we were travelling south, about 20 miles from where we last remembered being, and the sun was almost setting.  We both seemed to be coming out of a brain fog -- speech was very difficult.  My mother spoke first, saying in effect \"How did we get here, and how can it be this late?\" It took great effort for me to respond that I had no idea.  We literally did not say another word for the remaining forty minutes of the trip -- very unusual for two chatty sorts, especially given the circumstances.  I could not comprehend how I could have been driving in such an apparent fugue state, and that both of us were in the same condition was quite disturbing.  Neither of us could remember a single thing that had happened to us during the five or so hours just past... and neither of us were capable of talking about it -- or talking about anything else, at that time.  Even years later, it was exceedingly difficult for us to discuss the incident beyond the bare known facts, and both of us vividly recalled the incredible introversion of our thoughts on the way back to her house.  But we both, as we managed to admit to each other years later, were positive that we had seen \"something,\" that a craft (UFO) was involved.  Our difficulty talking about this event even years later seemed perhaps the result of a mental block of some sort placed by an outside source.  Especially given our individual and shared histories with UFO sightings (also witnessed by others numerous times), there was little doubt in either of us that we\\'d had an intense and lengthy encounter with something, and some entities, decidedly not of this world.  The roads we were travelling  My mother was an accountant for a furniture/appliance store, and I was a chef/restaurant owner (physically a bit disabled now, thanks to years of heavy lifting, etc.) and am now a professional artist and writer.  This report is probably only the first in a somewhat long line -- it\\'s time I deal openly with the strangeness in my life that seems to have revolved around UFOs, and this is step one.  I\\'m very open to discussing the full range of experiences and incidents with an investigator, if you or an associate are interested.  I will also consider hypnosis in order to penetrate the mental veil concealing the two incidents of missing time, providing that the hypnotherapist is reputable and well-versed in probable abduction incidents.  Those two incidents have haunted me for so long -- once for nearly fifty years -- and I\\'d like to know the truth, however discomfiting it may be.

       "       'Bright light in woods moves toward witness; witness was left disoriented. I think that this happened in the spring/summer of 1982. It might have been 1983, but I am pretty sure that I had just completed my first year of college and I have a vague memory of feeling irresponsible about missing too many days of work at my part-time job. I have to admit that I can\\'t pin this down exactly. I know it happened no earlier than 1982 and no later than 1984. There were green leaves on the trees; the temperature was neither particularly hot nor cold.  I had a close friend who was several years younger. I think I was 19-20 years old, so she was 16 or 17. Her father was a boy scout troop leader, and he, her mother, and other adults were taking their troop camping at Swallow Falls State Park, near Oakland, Maryland. (Here is the url for more information: http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/western/swallowfalls.html.) She was a bit of a problem teen, and there was no way that her parents were going to let her stay home alone while they took the troop to Swallow Falls. She had to go, but they told her that she was allowed to bring a friend. She asked me and I agreed to go along.  Looking at the Swallow Falls camping maps, I believe that we camped in the Youth Group Loop. I’m not sure exactly where on the loop we were positioned (http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/maps/msfmap.html), but my gut tells me we were in camp site number 2 (http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/maps/sfyg.html). I am sure that no one was in camp site 3, but I am not clear if any one was in camp 1. I have no recollection of seeing any other campers outside our party during the entire trip.  The camping loop went fairly deep into the forest of huge old trees. On the first night, there was a heavy rain storm. My friend and I were sleeping on the ground in a small two-man tent. We were utterly miserable; our tent was damp and leaking. It kept raining into the next day, and in fact, by the evening, it was absolutely pouring. We decided to spend the night in her father\\'s car. It was parked facing the loop road, next to the encampment. My friend, who was a tiny person, took the backseat, and I planned to sleep in the driver\\'s seat in recline.  I recall that we sat in the car talking for hours while the rain pounded the car. I don’t remember thunder or lightning, just driving rain and some winds. I don’t think the car had a lighted clock. (Now that I think about it, I’m not sure cars had lighted clocks in the early 1980s.) But I guess it was around midnight.  At some point while we conversed, I noticed a light through the front windshield.  I can remember that it illuminated the hard streaks of rain hitting the glass.  We both stopped talking, so I assume that she also saw the light. I never turned my head to look at her in the back seat as the light wended its way toward us. It was yellow-greenish and about as bright as a car headlight pointed full on very bright. It did not have a defined shape because of this brightness, but I assume its core was round. It moved smoothly, about 3-5 feet from the ground, swerving gently a few times to avoid trees. I remember wondering whether it was a car on the muddy loop coming from camp 1. Then I thought, \"Maybe it’s someone walking with a really bright lantern.\"   My last memory of the light is as it reached the front of our car.  I retain an image of it crossing in front of us, as if it was going to follow the loop out of the woods to the parking area.  But I can’t recall it actually doing that.  I think I saw it start to illuminate the tents that were to my right.  The next thing I remember is disorientation then turning around to my friend to say, \"That was weird.\" The two of us immediately picked up our conversation from before the light appeared.  After that night in the woods, I didn’t think about the odd light for years. I don’t recall ever mentioning it to anyone until the early 1990s, when I read a description of ball lightning.  How it can glide and make unusual maneuvers. I decided that was what we had seen and mentioned it to my husband and friends.  When I was in my 30s, my friend visited from Arizona, where she then lived. I asked her if she remembered that night in the car. She did, except for the light. In her memory, we sat in the car talking in the driving rain until we fell asleep.  Now, after another decade of consideration, I’m no longer sure what I saw was ball lightning and lean more toward a UFO-type experience or that I am simply misremembering an event with a rational explanation: a car; a camper.  I have to rule out it was a vehicle for several reasons. First, there was only one light, not two, although I concede it could have been a car with one headlight. But I don’t remember a car. Second, the only source for a car would have been camp site 1. From where I sat, site one would have been at approximately 1 o’clock. I would have been at roughly 7 o’clock. My memory is of the light coming toward us from about 10 o’clock, out of the woods. I don’t remember seeing camp site 1 occupied. If it was, and this was a car from that site, why would they drive the long way around the unpaved, muddy loop in the storm to exit into the parking area?  Was it a person with a lantern? It might have been someone armed with an incredibly bright light, but I don’t remember a person. I’ve wondered if it was someone from camp site 1 walking to the toilets. I personally have no memory of the bathhouse that is shown on the youth group loop detail, however, a site 1 camper would again be taking a very long route to get to the toilets, through driving rain on a muddy trail.  I also wonder about the disorientation I felt. I don’t know exactly what time it was when the light appeared, so I don’t know if we were missing time, but something felt wrong. I also wonder why my friend and I never discussed it, and why I barely recalled the incident until I read the description of ball lightning years later. I don’t remember any other experiences that could be construed as abductions. Perhaps they were coming for her? We had a falling out in the late 1990s and no longer are in touch or I’d ask her if she has had further experiences. Aliens? A one-headlight car? Another camper? Ball lightning? I don’t know what I saw that night and I never will, I suppose. It’s been bothering me so much recently that I thought I should file a report.

       "       'Missing 3 hours of time after seeing lights behind car. My boyfriend and I had been driving around the back dirt roads in Kitsap and Mason Counties. The area can be found on a map in what would be north west of Belfair on the north shore penninsula and about an equal distance south west of the Bangor/Silverdale area of Kitsap County in an area known as Tahuya.  My boyfriend pulled over and parked the car next to the road.  I don\\'t remember what day or month it was as it happened so long ago but I do know that it was summer because it was in the middle of the night and it was warm enough to have the windows down without wearing a jacket.  In Washington I would say it was late July or August.   I don\\'t know how long we sat there but I do remember asking my boyfriend what time it was. He told me and then I began to light a cigarette.  The next thing I remember was what appeared to be car headlights coming from an odd angle behind us, but I didn\\'t hear any engine noise.  I remember we both noticed the lights as my boyfriend was looking at his driver\\'s side mirror at them. I wondered who else would be out here in the middle of nowhere at this hour. The lights came up behind us so smoothly almost as if they were floating.  Then the next thing I remember (which seemed to be only seconds passing)is no lights and I was looking at my boyfriend and I asked him again what time it was as if I were reliving the minute before.  He told me and it was 3 hours later.   We just looked at each other wondering how that could be.  I think I said something to the effect of \"I have been trying to light this cigarette for 3 hours?  Didn\\'t I just ask you what time it was?\"   All I can tell you is that this moment in my life has never gone away.   The bottom line is that lights came up behind our car on a dirt road making no noise at all and with their dissapearence I lost 3 hours of time.   We were in our early twenties at the time and I never told anyone because I didn\\'t think anyone would believe me.  Now even after all these years I believe something happened to us that night that was not normal or of this earth.  When I did sleep next I had a vivid dream of being examined by aliens.  I don\\'t know if this dream was my minds way of trying to account for the missing time or if this is what happened to me during the three missing hours.  I guess I\\'ll never know.  I still remember the dream though as if it I had it yesterday.  In case it could be related to my missing time I will explain it as best as I can, but like I said I don\\'t know if it is related to the 3 missing hours and the strange lights behind the car.  I was laying on a metal table but I wasn\\'t cold or hard. There were several, 3 for sure, (beings? not human) around the table. One to the left of my head one behind me and one to my right side. I had the feeling they were males although I couldn\\'t tell what sex they were.  They had greyish colored skin and bigger heads then we have with no hair. I remember the heads as being larger especially in the back area more so then ours.  They were talking to me without a mouth I heard them in my head.  They were telling me that I was fine and they seemed happy or I was getting a happy feeling from more then one of them.  It was like being in a room with a group a happy chatty people.  I felt that my boyfriend was close but not in the same room as me.  I also received the feeling that he was fine just as I was. The one to the left of my head asked me if I would have a baby for them. I said I would but that I couldn\\'t have babies and I asked them if they could fix me so that I could and could have one for me too.  I felt a sense of confusion from them and that\\'s all I remember of my dream.  The one I really looked at was the one to my left.  I don\\'t remember them wearing clothes and they were what I would call scrawny except for their heads.  I also don\\'t remember them having ears. The mouth area was like a slash and they didn\\'t have lips like we do and I don\\'t remember seeing inside the slash of the mouth so I don\\'t know how deep it was. The mouth was smaller then our opening for a mouth, about half as small. I couldn\\'t tell where the light in the room was coming from but the room had a bluish cast to it.   My comment about not being able to have babies was most likely due to my earlier misscarriage that left scaring and I was told that I would probably not be able to get pregnant again.  However 5 years later I did.  So, was this dream related to my missing 3 hours?  I don\\'t know but unlike most dreams I still remember this one as if it happened yesterday and I still relate it to my missing time.  I am not a crazy person. I would be very embarrassed if anyone I know found out that I thought I may have been abducted by aliens.  I have always thought of myself as a sceptic, but I can\\'t or never have been able to explain the lights behind our car and the missing 3 hours, nor why this dream doesn\\'t fade from my memory.   I would like to know if anyone else in my area saw anything similiar or unusual during the summer of 1987 in the late evening or early morning (before sunrise) during a very warm night in the Tahuya/Dawatto area of the Kitsap penninsula.  Please don\\'t use my name publicly. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))',\n",
       "       'Three large white lights on the underside of an mini van sized ufo at approximately 150 feet away for about ten minutes. I was in my neghbor\\'s backyard shoveling snow off of the basketball half court when I noticed the UFO.  It was to in the front of the house just over the oak tree tops in an opening in the tree branches that made it visible.   I was convinced that this thing was watching me.  It was about the size if a mini van.  It was the shape of a plump M&M candy.  It was inky black in appearance and would have probably gone unnoticed by me save for the lights in it. There were three white lights on its underside. They were about the size of those saucer sleds that kids use. They were not airplane lights but big and round lights. The lights curiously did not illuminate the rest of the object.  It remained absolutely silent and stationary for maybe ten minutes or so.  I was terrified the moment that I saw it.  I also stood motionless the entire time of ten minutes.  All I could do was hope that this was not going to turn out to be an abduction.  I was fearfully dreading seeing those little monsters with big black almond shaped eyes.   Nothing at all happened to me.  I decided to start shoveling again and pretend it wasn\\'t there. The moment that I looked away the UFO left.  I just remember looking down for a second and then looking back up there and there was no sighn of it. Then I ran somewhat toward where the thing was in order to get to the gate and then run into my house.  I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. That was all that happened. My personal interpretation of this was loooong thought over and pounded through in a lot of objective consideration.  In the end and after many changes in my life and a radical transformation which began in late 1996 I came to a sound and peace filled conclusion.  If I indeed saw something that night (meaning that this was not in my mind) it was unquestionably supernatural. The thoughts that I progressivly began to consider brought more and more confusion, meaninglessness and ultimately despair into my heart.  What would the existence of alien Intelligent life mean to me?  Why would they come here?  Why me?  What does this say about humanity\\'s origen and its inextricably linked purpose for existence and its destiny?  Is the abduction phenomenon real?   I read quite a number of books about all these things.  Many different explanations were offered. The acceptance of any one of them would impact my world view tremendously and therefor my life would be conducted based on my conclusions which I was desparate for.   Years later after putting faith in the God of the Bible and His Son, Jesus, I saw things in a new and clear light.  Mankind is actually created by an entirely supernatural God.  We were created to be his children.  This means that we are in many ways like Him.  One thing is for sure:  He is the absolutely most superior person there is.  We are created as the most phenominal and superior life form, reflecting our creator (in the image of God).  Thus, there can not be any life that is more capable or \"intelligent\" in any way comparable to Mankind.  There are however both good and evil entities called angels (messengers of God. The \"evil\" ones wish to hide and distort the truth about God and thus bring death and destruction to humanity through sin.  God conversly works through His unique and eternal God-man Son, Jesus, to intervine and save people.  Hence, the reality that there is to the UFO/abduction phenomenon can be attribed to these categories:  1. Natural or explainable phenomenon. 2. People who are crazy to one level or another, or on drugs, etc. 3. Secret military aircraft. 4. Evil spirits expressing themselves through UFOs and abductors as an effective means to mislead people into believing in lies about God and mankind.  Lies like \"you are your own god\" or Atheistic evolution theories, various magical, new age, and eastern mysticism worldviews.  The list never ends because there is no reliable measuring tool for interpreting the phenomenon. As a believer in Jesus however, I have made it a priority to either validate or repudiate the Bible as a true book from the one creator God.  A careful search into this will reveal to anyone that the book is fully relable. Jesus can save us and also bring the universe and life into its proper context. This is liberating. \"If you obey my words than you are really my disciples (followers); and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.\" Jesus, John 8:31-32.  Have you experience truth and freedom? ((NUFORC Note:  Date of event may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))',\n",

       "       'cloaked stingray shaped object lowflying only saw moisture build up around front end of object my wife saw it first as we layed down to sleep, out the window about 800ft up, moving about the speed of the police choppers when they circle. the object itself was completely invisible but there was a lot of moisture in the air and we could see a build up of moisture around the front end and what appeared to be some sort of tail piece. the only way i can describe the form that the moisture was contouring to is like that of a sting ray. very flat and smooth edges, almost flowingthrough the air, the sides were like the sides of a sting ray in movement flowing from where they met a somewhat of a center area in a wavelike motion out to the tips of them. the area trailing the front arch of moisture seemed to flow in the same pattern but horizontally as opposed to vertical flowing of the front wing like area. I DID NOT SEE THE OBJECT JUST THE MOISTURE BUILDING UP IN THE AREAS IT WOULD OF ANY KNOWN FLYING OBJECT. i would not have believed my wife had i not seen it my self, it was very brief but unquestionably clear. no lights or sounds or abductions or cell phone static, it seemd to be a perfectly cloaked device using motion for propeltion as opposed to a fuel source. im still having trouble believing it but this was no known object to me and it was undoubtably clear.',\n",

This abduction also occurred 4 days before my 1st ever UFO sighting.  The UFO sighting had multiple witnesses as well.  I went to bed watching TV on my phone.  I do this often and charge the phone while I do it so it's fully charged when I wake up.  An hour and 45 minutes later I tell myself in my sleep that I need to wake up.  I just feel like I need to awaken and feel panicked.  I wake up and immediately reach for my phone.  But it's dead, but charging at 1%.  It cannot die on the charger?  And even had I not been charging it, it would not have died watching TV for only an hour and 45 minutes.  Even if it had died, how could it be charging suddenly?  I had an uneasy feeling like I had missed time. I have a guy feeling that I was abducted and grabbed my phone just as they took me.  They had me long enough my phone died. I was returned and my phone put on the charger just as I woke up.  I didn't really believe this until I saw an actual UFO a few days later.  Now I'm extremely nervous to be by myself now.

Monday afternoon, I noticed that I had a terribly sore spot on my left arm where it junctions with my torso.  I was confused as to why it would hurt.  Being as ill as I was, I never undressed.   On Tuesday, May 9th, while dressing so my husband could take me to the doctor he noticed this triangular shaped bruise, one ince long, with three red lines going thru it horizontally!  I looked and said, \"That\\'s where the pain has been.\"  I know I did not do this by hitting or bumping into anything.   While at the doctors, at Kaiser, I wrote on a pad of paper, Look at this!  The doc said, \"Well, we know you\\'re prone to brusing easily, we could do another test but this looks like you got hit with a three-pronger.\"  I have no idea what she meant.   At that time, I couldn\\'t even make a sound, I had lost my voice totally. So I just shrugged my shoulders and left the office.

       "       'I saw a six story high, one block long flying saucer sitting on the Utah/Idaho border that silently disappeared when my car approached. In April 1989 right after midnight I was driving alone in my car south on the road between Pocatello, Idaho, and Tremonton, Utah.  I was on a stretch of land where I could only see lights of a couple of farm houses far off to the west of the road.  Just before the Idaho/Utah border I noticed some pulsating lights that were red, yellow, green, blue.  I thought it was a very large lighted road sign.  I have driven that road many times before and thought it strange that I had never seen a road sign along that road before.  I thought, \"What is a lighted road sign doing out here in the middle of nowhere?\"  I was to later realize that the lights were right on the Utah - Idaho border.   As I got about a block away suddenly the pulsating lights started to blend into each other and a very large black disk shaped object slowly rose up.  It made no sound whatsoever. It was just after midnight and the sky was filled with stars.  I could see the disk shaped object only becau! se it covered the stars.  It was about 6 stories high and a block long with these lights now blending into each other around the center of the saucer shaped disk.  It hovered above me in the air for only a few minutes, and then suddenly went straight east (not upward, but sideways) and disappeared behind the range of mountains to the east.  I was so shocked I stopped the car along the side of the road and sat there for I don\\'t know how long. I was trying to figure out what I had just witnessed.  Then what appeared to me to be a few min. later, a couple of cars passed me along the road. I became frightened that the object might come back, so I turned on the engine and drove to my home in Orem, Utah.  I arrived home around 3 am from what should have been a 2 or 2 1/2 hour drive, so I may have lost some time inbetween.  I did not know who to report the incident to so I called the Preston Idaho police department to find out if there were any other reports of UFOs in the area.  The wom! an on the line said there were none.  So I wrote a letter to th! at depar tment outlining the incident just so it could be officially reported to someone.  Later I noticed that my bellybutton was reeking a small amount of pus, as was my right ear.  The infections cleared up in a couple of weeks.     About 20 years later I went back to the area and looked at the field of sagebrush where the object had sat. I noticed three circles where the sage brush had not grown.  As I think back on the incident I feel it was an object being tested by our military, or why else would it be sitting right on the Utah/Idaho border?  A saucer from outer space would have no need to sit on an unmarked state border.  I have told only my close family members about the incident.  I later authored a book about Satanic Ritual Abuse (Twenty Two Faces:  Inside the Extraordinary Life of Jenny Hill and Her Twenty Two Multiple Personalities) and do not want to have my name associated with the incident as it would invite ridicule associated to my name. I wish to remain anonymous. I have had! no nightmares about the incident, nor any memory of abduction.  I am guessing at the year and month of the encounter and will have to re-check my files (which are locked away right now) for my original report of the incident to verify the date.',\n",

I was at the boating dock of the kayak from Piwniczna, and something began to swarm around me.  Was it a bat?  Moths?

       "       'A small yellow whitish light sphere flying and hovering with blue lights forming a ladder seen in Contoocook, NH, late evening in the fall. Low flying object (light) under overcast sky, first observed at up to several miles out at low altitude near l local hill with a long history of UFO phenomena. The light moved in a weaving motion towards me and came to a stop above me at about 100 feet and was silent. Many small lights moved from an area around my body and formed a rapid oscillating pattern around a yellow diffuse sphere of light 3-5 feet in diameter.  The smaller lights where just millimeters wide and where blue-white and spherical. The blue lights formed a ladder like pattern and descended into the grass at my feet.  These blue lights showed through the grass and moved in a sine wave like pattern. The pattern reversed and the lights retreated and the ladder of the lights then was gone. The lights around the larger single sphere where then gone. The larger sphere persisted for a small number of seconds and then blinked out. I was providing an external security patrol at Digital Equipment Corp., at that time. The date is approximate. I was experiencing an increase in an ecstatic mood at the time. I was sober and fully functional and was not experiencing any psychological issues such as stress or delusions or having a psychological condition.  I was not abducted but the scenario was a close encounter of the first order.  If I had walked into the ladder of small lights at my feet the encounter would have changed substantially was my feeling at the time.',\n",
       "       'Back on June 18 My friend and I at my house alone in Cumming , Ga Experienced a alien encounter and abduction. The 2 weeks prior to this event I had the feeling at my house which I live in alone with my dog and cat, that I was always being watched could and could never seem to catch the shadows/figures that seemed to be everywhere but no where in my house outside when I’d go look for something. I’d catch black figures and slight Shadows outside my windows in bushes. I’d see a white orbs floating around that were very clearly different from the fireflys out I’d see a white light floating behind one of roses Bushes. That night I had gone to the rest room my friend had let my dog off the back porch where she chased something that wasn’t there she proceeded to chase it til the start of the small section of woods that I had seen other Shadows had disappeared into.  When I walked out the door I heard my dog growling at something that neither of us could see at that moment my friend! looked over at me and said you have aliens walking down to her she had all the hair standing up on her body and when I gave the command to go track or find what ever. Peering into the woods not seeing my dog or anything we heard a shuffle in the fallen leaves then what seemed to be a high pitch screech high and louder than a jet engine would sound. After we went inside and tried just watching some tv and hang out from then on it sounded like little pebbles or something was tapping the side of my house and windows.  About 30 minutes later I went on my back porch to put some clothes in the dryer while in the laundry room my friend standing on the back deck starts insisting we need to get inside now seeing floating orbs floating around and a distant figure standing on the edge of the woods only being able to see its shape. We proceed to inside and from there it got even worse. My friend got the vibe and feeling that he didn’t wanna sleep on my couch. So I let him crash in my b! ed with me after turning out the lights and tv the whole house! seeming ly started vibrating the sounds of things hitting off my house became more intense the glasses in the kitchen vibrating we can both hear them in the cabinet. Sounds of languages and conversations that we could not understand start happening. Bumps and bangs in the back of my house where nothing was on and locked off from my animals through the night. My dog laying in bed with us seemed to start to growl then just stop like something calmed her. My cat popped in for a second said hi instead of sleeping on his bed in my room he left. After that I tried to sleep and my friend said he was going to try and mediate after that I can slighty remember not being able to move and a white light peering through my closed eyelids. The flickering of figures filling in around until at the same time me and my friend both popped up and when the lights came on we both had looks of sensory overload like someone just hit a reset on our Brains both in a what the fuck just happened look we tried t! o go to sleep with the lights on where the same thing happened. Until we both arose again at the same time looked at each other and said we need to get the fuck out now. Backing out of my driveway we both seemingly picked out a figure with some sort of owlish face standing in the woods. We left the house for the night. My friend went to a person who is open about this sort of things she took him to a spiritual cleanser she heard the story and said that it was out of her league. After meeting up the day after we both seemed to have IV prick marks on our arms in the same locations. Bruises and scratches and he had a mark on his side that looks like a medical device poked implanted something. Just seeing what the community has to say or what might be recommended.

       "       '3 Lights in triangle formation all seperate entities Merging with stars I was on my roof top balcony watching the stars its was one of the clearest nights ive ever seen this spring so far..  The moon as huge and bright to the left was a star and to the right a even brighter star further out..  After seeing the same sky for about 20 minutes i looked down to check my phone.  As i glance back up i noticed a formation of stars that were not there moments earlier.. I couldnt believe my eyes.  It was a in formation of a triangle but looked exactly like the rest of stars. as i began thinking what it could be one of the 3 lights started to disappear then the next and then the next .  I stood for 35 min in awww only to not see the formation show again.  One thing weird i noticed is in that window of me watching the stars i never witnessed a single place.  But few minutes after the sighting planes started rolling by as normal .  This area had a alien abduction case that was pushed under the rug about a man named Sees ...  My own good friend obe had videos on videos of ufos he captured on the island by the small airport.  One day he took his own life while watching these videos....Since i was 18 ive seen an amazing amount of movement in the skys.. Its weird even the military do patrol flights up here with apaches and other helicopters almost weekly. Something isnt right in this area of PA and i think i need to find answers,,, Ive seen lights come off the local mountain near the old Military armory here in Sunbury Pa..  Orange glowing orbs that start flying slow then zooom into space.  This area since 2000 has been high in sightings i know just from my own events ive witnessed one with 3 witnesses as well .  I have  at least 4 accounts of strange experiences.',\n",
       "       'A saucer flew over the roof of my car several times. Some time ago, while I was headed South on I-5, outside Bakersfield CA, a flying saucer made several passes over the roof of my car.  I did look out my window and could see an array of circular lights on the disk as it was approximately at each pass about 100 feet from the roof of my car.  I did not stop and maintained a speed of 60 mph as I was extremely afraid, but at the same time curious.  This happened in a time frame of about 15 minutes.  The saucer would sway out from my cars roof to 45 degrees to the side of the car at 200 feet then swing back over my roof.  It then would go to the other side of my car at about 45 degrees to an altitude of 200 feet again.  The diameter of the saucer was approximately 50 feet. I was outside of the city limits of Bakersfield, driving along the I-5 an oddly I was the only car on the freeway headed South.  I did not notice any traffic headed North bound either?  Was this an attempt by aliens to abduct me?  Yet they elected not to EMP my car, because I would have crashed.  Do you think they were waiting for me to stop the car?  The year was 2002.

I am not sure why I did that, but these beings dropped both of us as soon as I started to pray.   My son is harassed constantly.

       "       'Possible anti gravity propulsion system. First Reporting date: 9/24/1998 Reported to: Art Bell on Coast to Coast Show by fax. I would like to take this opportunity to report a possible Unidentified Flying Object [UFO]and share some insight into the greenish and while lights that are being seen in the sky. Five years ago, in 1993, I had a very close encounter or you could refer to it as a standoff with an Unidentified Flying Object [UFO] in the Reno, Nevada, area.  Excuse my pun, but I may be able to shed some light on the subject of UFO’s.  I cannot tell you exactly what it was, but I can tell you that it was not a fixed wing or helicopter that was currently known to the general public and there for unidentified. My military background includes an active duty tour in the U.S Air Force as an Aircraft Maintenance Specialist on F-111’s and other tactical fighter aircraft and over 20 years as a Security Forces Specialist and Supervisor.  I have extensive experience in Search and Rescue Air Support with both fixed wing and military helicopters. In this particular incident, I was working as a Sheriff’s Deputy on swing shift and had worked overtime until around 0300 hrs. in the morning.  I changed into my street clothing and put my Glock 9mm in my pancake style holster on my pants belt and put another magazine into my rear pocket.  I got into my Chevy 4x4 pickup truck and headed Northbound on highway 395 and to my residence in the Cold Springs Valley area near the Nevada/California boarder. At about 0330 hours, I crested a hill on Hwy. 395 at started to drop down in elevation towards the Cold Springs Valley.  I observed a bright white circular light moving back and forth across the base of Pevine Mountain near the Southbound lanes of Highway 395, which is several miles from the old Crystal Peak Mine access road. The area is about 5400 feet in elevation and the white light looked to be about 150 feet, above ground level or AGL.  At first, I thought that it might have been a Nevada Army National Guard OH-58 helicopter with a search light mounted on it, although I did not remember one on any of the aircraft I had flew on during search and rescue.  I did not see any formation lights, not strobes or anti-collision lights. At the bottom of the hill, I took the exit and pulled up to the stop sign. I sat there for a couple of minutes.  I shut my engine and lights off to listen to the sound of the main roto blades and did not hear anything.  The intensity of the bright light did not change as the object moved in a circular pattern and a nose mounted searchlight or a side mounted searchlight would have varied in intensity as the nose of the helicopter turned. I watched the bright light for about 3-4 minutes, before restarting my truck and turning on to Cold Springs Drive to drive around the dry lake bed.  While driving around the lake bed, I thought that another vehicle was catching up to me, as I would see some light and then it was gone.  After driving around the lake bed, I turned onto Brant Street and drove about 2 and half miles to my residence. As I pulled into my driveway and got out of my truck, I noticed that the very bright light was traveling along Brant Street at about 150 feet above the roadway towards my position. I moved out into the middle of the culdesac where it was dark and just stood there to try to get a glimpse of what type aircraft it was.  The nearest street light was about half a block away, so I felt a little safe in the dark.  My first thought was, \"Great, the object followed me home.\" The object was moving about 15-20 miles per hour and maintaining about 150-200 feet AGL.  I attempted to observe the outline of the object, but the brightness of the white light prevented it, and the intensity was much brighter that a searchlight that can be mounted on helicopters.  The light seemed to form a round disk type area about 100 ft. in diameter and was the only outline to judge the size of the object.  The object stopped moving towards me and remained stationary in the air with no main rotor blade or tail rotor noise. I was able to observe that there was a greenish hue to the white light emitting from the bottom of the object and said in a loud voice, “Oh, so that light is actually a low attitude propulsion system”.  I was surprised when the object moved sideways about 15 feet, as if answering the question. I got the feeling that I was being observed by a FLIR system- Forward Looking Infrared Radar.  I decided to wait this situation out, as I did not want to identify my house with a sleeping family. I was having a standoff with an UFO and I was thinking to myself, I bet they never abducted a cop with a Glock before and reached down and padded my Glock on my hip. I was hoping that the object would cross over me or move past me slowly, so I could get a look at the underside of the object.  The object maintained a silent hover for about 15 minutes as I stood still.  After about another five minutes, I decided to press the issue and threw up my hands and said very loudly, ”Well, what are you going do, do something”. The white light underneath the object became a greenish/ white color, with what looked like greenish water droplets as big as silver dollars spitting out the bottom for about 10 to 15 feet.  Then the greenish, white light shot straight up into the sky and was gone in about three seconds. I hung around for about another five minutes expecting the object to return since we were so close, but the object did not return and I searched the sky and did not see anything except the stars. I had feeling at the time that the object that followed me home may have been a either a Black Project from the Southern Desert area, or just a UFO. I did not mention the incident to anyone at the time as it would not have been politically incorrect to do so and could have been detrimental to my law enforcement carrier.',\n",
       "       \"watched a silver craft over central London  A harrier jump jet was sent to investigate it moved of but returned sooner after it disappea I do not remember the date but it was the day before Gerry Adams the leader of Sien Fein went to collect their parliamentary priviledges as members of the British parliament.   I had an overwhelming urge to go to Covent Garden which was unusual as I try to avoid tourists places.  My partner and I took our daughter and her friend to the swimming pool and went off for a drink at the opera terrace.  It was a bright clear day with not a cloud in the sky. My partner went to get the drinks and I sat at a table.  Looking up, I saw a silver disc in the sky. I couldn't tell you how far away it was or what size it was as I had nothing to compare it with. The waitress came to clear the table and I said to her 'Look at that,' pointing at the craft. She said it looked fantastic but took no further interest.  I spoke to the people on the next table and they said it was great but when I suggested it was a ufo they turned their backs and didn't want to know.   I showed it to my partner and we watched it for a while.  Passenger aeroplanes passed by without it moving but then it went away. A light silver plane flew over and when it had gone the craft reappeared.  We watched it until it disappeared again and a Harrier jump jet flew over rather slowly. When it passed the craft returned. It was almost a spiritual experience. Every so often clouds of luminous substance I presume were ionic bursts of blue and orange were emitted from the craft. It was a truly amazing sight looking down on the streets with all the people walking by, bulders high up on construction sites and nobody aware of the craft. A heliuum filled balloon escaped and flew off in a different direction. It was as though all this was happening to remove all doubt that it could only be a craft. We had to collect our daughter and I said to her and her friend do you want to see a ufo and they laughed thinking I was having a joke.  Walking back through Covent Garden I saw some one with a camera and asked him to take a picture but he could not speak English ! and I di dn't pursue the matter. We watched the craft until about 7.00pm. It did the most amazing thinks, appearing and disappearing instanly it was like blinking. Then a sort of brown cloud appeared around it and it disappeared and then returned. Eventually I had to take the children home. This happened a few years ago but it is very much in my memory. I have a degree in analytical chemistry and was wearing a new set of contact lenses. As a child I had many dreams of being abducted by aliens. One vivid one was of flashing lights at my bedroom window. I lived in a large house overlooking Elswick Park in NEwcastle upon Tyne England. In this dream I was the only person left. The aliens had everyone I knew and many other people I don't know where but I was aware of being the only one conscious. I also had dreams of beings in my bedroom thsat were so frighteneing that I would have to sleep with the light on and would always get into trouble for it but the trouble was never worse than the fear. Playing in the park one day I noticed a lump under my skin on my knee cap. I could mmove it around under the skin. It is not there now and I have not had it removed. There is more things in my life but can be interpreted in rational terms so I will not go into them here. I have often wondered about hypnotic regression to see if it would reveal more of my dreams but am unsure about the technique. After seeing the craft I looked into ufo's and alien abduction so my mind may be contaminated with this information.

       "       'i saw YHVH and afterwards there apopeared a ufo in the following week that took me from a tent and tatooed me, project blue book there. i had just finished my 7th grade class and had been given the advice to use the summer to think about what vocation i might have an interest in for the rest of my life.  i came home and talked about it with my favorite person, my foster dad, who worked for the veterans administration in town. we were living in the melrose edenbower addition and were in thhe foothills next to the Callahan Mtn. on doerner rd. we lived as devout roman catholics, and he said to pray about it and smiled. so i fasted and prayed in my bedroom for seven days. i felt a breakthrough in the spirit on the seventh day, a mind image of a path that was unmarked but available and i then quit and resumed household duties.  i expected i\\'d just be shown something, but i was unprepared as to what was about to happen. it was a summer mornming on the farm; everyone went outside after breakfast, leaving me alone to clean the living room. i was idly thinking while i cleaned about a career in either anthropology or egyptology or in vetrinary science  while i was cleaning. i heard a man calling my name, each time of the three times getting louder and louder! the last time it felt like i was being defragged like a computer program.  i was bewildered! i thought that i t ws my two playful practical joker brothers and a microphone, but there was neither of them at the house at that time, and when i asked who it was, i smelled the fragrance of frakincense and sandalwood and myrrh, like old style Roman Catholic high church incense....and as i looked around the room my attention ws directed to the ceiling and i heard a voice say, \"this is my beloved daughter in whom i am well pleased\"...i did a dougle take, amazed because i was adsopted and didn\\'t know who or where (not much) about where i was from)and i sensed but at this point i did not see another dimension which contained a large kings throne room and many people assembled all around a mighty King.  they were in a previously not seen or felt space above my head and i was below their feet - about four feet. then i said weakly, who are you? tell me who you are? i thought i was hallucinating, and i was scared! i was also only about 13 years old! then i looked up above the top of an opening \"arch\" doorway into the dining room, and the wall, the ceiling above as well, disappeared and i was looking upon a large object in the sky!  it was far away of about at least 10 miiles from me but it was huge! it was a waterfall of what looked like molten gold, and it was surrounded on both sides by thunder clouds flashing thunder and lightningm and surmounting the waterfall and its pool which was outrageous with detail of molten gold for water and golden flames, but also the powdered golden \"mist\" that arose from it and a huge rainbow over the top, with a white crystal throne and two persons radiating immense light that made me feel like i ws dying every time i looked up at them- a man standing to the right in long white robe, red robe that went over one shoulder and he looked just like the popular Jesus Christ pictures.  the wone sitting down had a long grey beard and wore a long flowing white robe.  One voice very powerfully vibrated through the air and me said, \"I AM JEHOVAH, the Father Almighty, the Creator Almighty.\" (note: this means the tetragrammaton. i was standing there amazed, with a broom in my hand and i noticed i was still holding it and i immediately thought of the moses movie and took off my shoes and put the broom on the ground and did the same thing, got on the floor on my knees, and started praising God.  i thought to ask HIM. HE asked me to be HIS Wayshower, and showed me a vison of a misty white large road in the sky with viscous black walls on either side, and that the light of the Creator fell on on this road.  HE said, \"If anyone argues with you about what you think, do say and testify to leave them by the wayside.\" i was shown a image of me grown up as an adult showing a indian man into the viscous wayside, where GOD looked down on his entrapped form crying and turned away from him with finality.  i then said l\"let everything i think, do say and testify to be of you and not of myself so that otheres will know you have sent me.\" then i worshipped THEM and i looked up from where i was bowed and they were gone.  in the afterward, my foster monm and two child siblings entered the house and said to me \"what happpened? you\\'re glowing very bright.\" I was lit up like a neon sign, and they put a sheer curtain over my head so they could look at me.  afterwards, there was a ufo silver disk, with a bulging ring of protholes, about 15\\' across that landed in the next week while i was up at the nextdoor neighbors camping out and i ws \"abducted\" from the tent, given a physical examination and tatooed with an egyptian heiroglyphic that is the name for NIT- a weaving shuttle- on my right groin area over the ovary.  my stomach bulgeed and i felt like i had radiation sickness for the next 2 weeks, causing my family to be tightlipped and very worried, but they refused to tell anyone because my dad worked for the government.  the blue book came out and white curtained the area of the landing, because the craft burnt depressions into the asphalt road at the bend right past the house where i lived.  I peeked over the edge of the hill and was pspotted and photographed (glowing) because i wanted to see what was going on behind the white curtains. that fall, the family doctor gave everyone a complete physical examination and photographed my tatoo for the FBI (i saw the markings card marked FBI which the doctor with alot of excalamations filled out and took a one step polaroid picture of the mark.  i didn\\'t tell him the truth.  and that began to be the first of countless ufo contacts with the good guys of Heaven.  unfortunately, years later, the two other girls with me in the tent have succumbed to cancer, although that didn\\'t happen till they hit their adult years.  i began to be very talented and did amazing things which my foster family couldn\\'t get over, like levitation and fire shooting from my hands and body.  i was a pretty good little girl, and i was known as a mindreader and very pronounced psi talented.  athere were other events, but this is where it first started, although i remember instances in milpitas california as a baby where shadowy \"white\" people like ghosts used to come into our house and visit me, telling me not to forget what i was here for, to be with me when i was scared at night, etc.  alot about don\\'t forget the promise, the plan.  that\\'s all for now.  these are not all the details of what happened the first time for me on doerner road in oregon.  oh, and the guys that got off the craft were humanlike, with golden blonde short, curly hair and gold and purple close fitting jumpsuits and white silverish boots.  they didn\\'t seem to have seams in the clothes who piloted the craft that burnt the holes in the road.

       "       'NOT a ufo report. This is an abduction. this is not a craft report. It is an abduction report I don\\'t know who to write to submit so I chose you. I was 2 years old and I believe I was abducted. I have the same description as most, levitating, bright lights coming from windows. I was not afraid, I felt calm, I just remember floating from my Hydabed in the front room and I turned vertical. I look around around my body,only to find no one carring me. I levitated south through the front room into the kitchen and it was dark then. when I got to the back door in the kitchen i just \"blacked out\" thats about it. I\\'m really serious about this, even being 2 years old my memory is so vivid. I remember telling my friends in daycare, and throughout.

       "       \"Shape of object: Upside down stainless steal circular bowl Size of bowl: 12 - 15 inches in diameter Lasars: 3 inch diameter lasar beam was illuminated from the bottom of the craft shining down to the ground. Lasar Color: White Object on Ground: approximately 3 ft curled up rubber or snake like object  Unique Characteristic of Sighting: The bowl was upside down, hanging by a black 3 inch diameter solid material, it was hanging from a power line in an intersection.  Unique Characteristic of Sighting: The traffic lights were normally extremely bright on my drive home from work. This particular evening, I noticed the traffic lights were extremely dim.   Description of the sighting: It was a clear night on my way home from work. I had driven this route every night for the last several months. The traffic lights always illuminated up the area and you could see it for a couple miles. I noticed in the distance the traffic lights at the intersection where I turned left were extremely dim on this night. At first I assumed there must be something wrong with the lights. I figured maybe some sort of construction was going on. Anyway, as I approached the intersection I saw this bowl like object hanging from a 3 inch diameter cable looking connection device shining a 3 inch diameter lasar on the ground. I came to a complete stop just under the lasar so as to put the lasar right outside my driver window. I looked on the ground to see there was a rubber looking 1 inch diameter 3 feet long snake looking thing in the lasar beam. I looked back up and saw the under side of the bowl. It was solid black with the exception for the 3 inch diameter beam shining down. I started to put my hand out to see if I could determine its temperature and immediatley got nervous and turned left and stopped to car. I got out of the car to examine the device more closely from outside my car and it was suddely gone.  I didn't hear any sound. I didn't see it fly away. Of course, after I drove underneath and turned left I was in the car and it was to my back for about 20 seconds. I figured it took off while my back was turned. I didn't experience any loss of time. I didn't experience any abduction. It was simply hanging there and appeared to cause the traffic lights to go dim.  It was only 12 to 15 inches in diameter. It was hanging from the power lines shining a 3 inch diameter beam onto the approximatlely 3 foot snake like object. And when it disappeared, the traffic lights were back to full illumination. The long rubber like object or snake like object was gone too. Everything was normal and no sign of the object. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

       "       'it was the most amazing thing i have ever seen, but i dont remember what happened. i am 23 years of age. this happened when i was about 8 or 9. so im not shure if it is relevant or not, but i just found your website and decided to write to you and tell my story. this is not a joke or a dream i had or anything like that. i remember it very vaguley but i think its like that for a reason. here is my story... it was sometime in summer of i think 1990 or 1991. i was about 8 or 9. i have an outside porch that is all screened in. it is pretty big. that day me and my family were haveing a get together. im not shure what for. it might of been my birthday. as night came arround the grown ups were sitting on the deck at the table talking and i was out their with them. their must have been about 8 of us. i think me and my sister were the only children. she is 3 yrs younger than me. i remember seing this huge object hovering above the ground. it was not in the sky as other ufo reports. it was about a house distance from the street. i remember a huge array of yellow, orange, and red lights. some of them were flashing. i was in absolute shock. it appeared out of nowhere. the ship was illuminated but where we were it was still sorta dark. the the backs of the adults in front of me looked like silioutes. i dont remember anything after that at all. all that i recall is what i told you. noone in my family has ever spoken of that night once. i never did eaither until i was about 18. i told my best friend at the time but it is such an unbelivable story that my friend thought i was jokeing. i never brought it up to any of my family members. im really not shure why. i dont evenm know if they would remember. just the other night i told my girlfriend who also belives in aliens and other things people tend to be skecptial about. she convinced me to ask my mother if she remembers. so this week i plan on doin that. im not shure how to approach it though. anyway. thats my story. im not shure if it made much sence to you. its still a mystery to me. i decided it must have been an abduction of some sort, i think. im really not shure. thank you for your time.

       "       \"FRIGHTENING MIB ENCOUNTER? The story that I am about to tell you is hard to describe.  I have always hesitated in telling this srange story to many people in the past because they might think that I made the whole thing up, or am crazy.  Trust me, this story is very much true and accurate.   What I saw those two late nights back in 1992 etc. still gives me chills up and down my spine even today.  When I was a very young boy in my teens I had two very real and serious UFO close encounters.  They both happened in Kentucky, and were very much real.  There were other witnessess too.  I remember them both well, and they somehow changed my life forever.  They made a UFO believer out of me.   One was a very powerful loud object and light hovering above me and my cousins one day for several minutes.  Were we abducted?  I cannot remember.  The other sighting was of a very large glowing disk with lights that my Grandparent's and I saw in the black night sky up close.  The second sighting happened a few years later.  When I got older I left home and moved away to another city to start a career.  I lived alone in a small one bedroom apartment.  Late one night around midnight I was awakened by a very strong sense that someone, or something, was in my apartment with me.  I looked out into the hallway and I was totally astonished, and scared to death, at what I saw.  In my bedroom at the left end corner of the foot of my bed stood a man, a man in total black ( a shadow like person).  The hallway light was on, and his manly form was unmistakable in my bedroom.  I could definately make out the form of a man with an older 1940's style hat on, and his body outline with an overcoat on too-both completely dark black.  Believe me, this person or thing was really there.  I am a born again Christian, and my honesty is something that I hold in high regard.  I simply could not move-my body was frozen in fear and anxiety.  I quickly glanced outside my bedroom window to see if he was just a reflection from outside of some sort, but their was no reflection.  I opened and closed my eyes many times, and shook my head, to see if I was dreaming.  I shockingly finally realized that I was not.  My heart was beating so fast I could hear it pounding, and I really thought that I was going to have a heart attack.  I could not move, and the man just stood there in complete silence for close to twenty minutes staring at me.  Finally he just somehow vanished in an instant.  It took me an hour or longer to calm down and do a search in my apartment.  The doors were all locked.  About four months later the exact same thing happened again.  I was suddenly awakened, and there at the same location was the same black shadowy man standing at the left end corner of my bed staring at me.  Again I could not move, and was again frozen with fear and anxiety.  My heart was beating again very rapidly too.  This time though I finally managed to ask him who he was, and what did he want.  He just stood there staring at me again for around twenty minutes or so.  Then he just practically vanished again.  Even today I cannot begin to explain who or what the thing was that I saw.  I have heard strange stories of MIB's (Men In Black) visiting people who have had UFO encounters before, but this was crazy. I had never taken them so seriously before.  Now I wonder.  Anyway, the strange and mysterious man in black never came back to my apartment again-thank God.  I hope that you believe my story.  Yes, I know this story sounds crazy, but it really happened exactly the way that I told it to you.  Something happened to me those two frightening nights beyond my understanding.  I DO know for a fact that the UFOs are real!----JG ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.

       "       \"My husband and I were on a holiday in Kelowna B.C staying on the top floor (5th) at The Queen Anne Hotel in the old section of town. We arrived back at the hotel about 11 o'clock. My husband, binoculars in hand, was at the window looking skyward as he often did. He called me to come and look too. What I saw still stays in my mind though it's been more than ten years ago. A bright light was stationary high up in the sky strobing pale yellowish light, then red, then green then back to yellowish and so on.We watched it for more than half an hour.Another white light came from the east and moved horizontally toward the brighter one.It disappeared as though flying into the brighter one, then a second zoomed toward the larger light and disappeared into it in the same manner. The the brighter object then dimmed it's light and headed straight up very quickly.It stopped briefly straight over where it had been then zoomed off at high speed in am easterly direction. We know how long the sighting lasted because Jay Leno was just coming on (11:30). We were still watching the activity when Conan O'Brien came on one hour later. We reported the sighting to Mufon here in Vancouver and spoke about it at one of their meetings. I also wanted to see whether anyone else had seen this and put an in the Kelowna paper. I received two responses and a phone call from others who had similar experiences though not of this one.One woman married to a forest ranger saw three large triangular craft flying at night. Another man had seen what he called paisley objects on the lake. The radio station there told me that others had seen this kind of thing quite often. I've since heard of an abduction in the Kelowna area involving a former school mate. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))\",\n",
       "       'I witnessed an abduction from my backyard. I was playing in my backyard at 6:00 and suddenly I saw something in the sky.  I watched the craft as it wobbled around then a light came out from it. The light was so bright that I had to turn away.  I looked at it again and it shot upwards with screaming coming out of it.',\n",
       "       'My sister saw something highly unusual from the windows of her second floor apartment in Hyannis, Massachusetts. She is 56 years old and works as an artist and designer.  She is very good at creating animation using her Mac computer.  I asked her to write down the experience she had so that I could report the incident as a possible UFO. She did that for me and she also supplied me with the picture and the animation that I have attached.  The picture (lightshape2.jpg) is a representation of the object on a photograph of the tops of the two trees where the object appeared to hover.  The animation (lightshapelayers2.mp4) is her attempt to represent the shifting nature of the object—at times amorphous and without apparent boundaries of edges, at times with edges more distinct.  She says it is a pretty good representation of what she saw. We both use Macs so I hope it translates well to PC computers.  Here is what she wrote about the experience:  We were being lashed by the remnants of Hurricane Noel (Nov 2 or 3, 2007-I can’t remember the exact date but I think it was the 2nd). There was gale force wind, thunder, lightning, heavy rain.  I was sitting in my computer room near the window in my second-floor studio when I noticed that there was something strange about the lightning. There was too much of it, it was like watching a strobe light, and the thunder didn’t seem to correspond. It was like the lightning was spelling out something in Morse Code. Dit dit dit dit, etc. And it was too near, too bright and very unusual. I started to feel a little uneasy.  But it was just a storm so I waited. I decided that I should turn off the computer because it was the type of weather that causes power outages. Just after doing so I sat quietly in the darkness of the room for a while. Then there was a bright flash and a brilliant light illuminated the entire yard, driveway and all the nearby area about 30 feet in every direction (an estimate). But it still didn’t seem like lightning, and I did not want to look out for fear of what I might see. It felt strange and scary because the illumination lasted for several minutes without flickering or changing although it was clearly undulating. It was brighter than broad daylight-maybe10 times brighter than a cloudless summer day at noon. I wanted to believe that this was ordinary lightning but something scared me and something in me really did not want to know what it was out there, even though I was compelled to look. I had a sense of fear that made me want to crawl under the table. But I sat still and looked out of the north window at the yard and rooftop of the cottage next door. I could see everything clearly bathed in this brilliant white light. It was like there was a giant magnifying lamp, and it stayed unmoving and illuminated, undulating for a long stretch of time, possibly 5-10 minutes. All this time I was sitting rooted to my chair with a window in front (north-facing) and another window to my right (east facing window), both with wide-open views of the weather phenomena outdoors.  At this point in time, I was just witnessing what I thought to be a very unusual lightning storm.  Suddenly the light just went out, or rather seemed to have rolled away. It was dark, save for the intermittent “dits” of light that I described as being regular and code-like. I felt a sense of relief-I noticed after the fact that I was very tense. During the episode I was transfixed, I could have moved but I was trying to focus with all of my senses because of the unusual nature of the lightning so I stayed seated in my chair. When the lights suddenly went out, I moved closer to the window on my right (east)- which has a parallel view of the cottage and property behind my house. I was glad whatever it was, was gone. I knew whatever it was, was strange.  Then the light suddenly appeared again, brilliant as ever, illuminating everything, making everything seem like bright and flat white light, filling the sky and everything reflecting it in a bright white glow. I got a really creepy feeling and then I looked out and up over the back of the cottage, in a space like a little valley between two treetops, there seemed to be a consolidated light-ball of some sort: large, like the size of a bus maybe, round and with a concentrated brilliance that was outlined by a thin gradated line - which made the shape seem to blend with the surrounding brilliance. Immediately I thought I was seeing a UFO, then I ducked under the table, the surface of which is about a foot above the window’s lower ledge. It’s an old drawing board and I had it backed up to the window. Under the table I could look out at it.  I looked at it, stared at it, frozen with fear but compelled by curiosity. I was watching it and almost couldn’t breathe. I saw it seem to change shape, as if the thin gradated line modulated, it reminded me of pixilation overlap used in film special effects to depict morphing, it changed from a round circle to a diamond shape, with what seemed like symmetrical filigree-like “steps” making the edges seem dimensional and not flat. It was like a ragged-edged diamond and the edges again were softly outlined by a thin gradated line. It reminded me of the Russian painter Kasimir Malevich’s painting “White on White”, a painting consisting of a tilted white square on a white backgound. Only a slight variation of brushstroke allows the viewer to see the shape emerge. As difficult as it was to stare for long at the object because of its brightness, the edges of the object were very unusual and detailed, with various tiers along the edges coming forward and receding.  After watching it for a minute or two I got really scared and ducked down under the table. I felt like it was a UFO type of thing, even though I kept trying to frame it within my usual knowledge and expectations, all the while “knowing” that it didn’t fit into any frame of reference in my experience, and that there had to be an intelligence involved so I started to “talk” to it, saying “Please go away, you’re scaring me” and “I don’t want to get abducted” and stuff like that. I remember saying, “whatever you do, don’t hurt my cats”.  But I felt a sense of fear and panic that was undeniable. There was no thunder.  I crawled out of the studio on my hands and knees because I didn’t want to be “seen” even though I already felt like I had been seen and there was no escaping it. I entered the living room where there is a large picture window facing the same direction (east) as the window in the studio with the table. I stayed on the floor. The illumination in the general area remained for some time but fright kept me from looking anymore so I don’t know what might have happened. However, after a few more minutes the illumination dissipated, there was darkness and a few “dits” of light again, but then it was as if the storm had just quieted down a little, everything seemed again like a normal storm - there was regular lightning, but it was farther away and had the accompanying distant thunder, it continued to rain and the winds continued through the night. I had a feeling like I didn’t know if I had seen what I had seen.  So I constructed a still image showing the relative positioning above the trees, just to serve my memory and help me to realize that whatever it was that I saw, it was something unusual. I followed that with making a short animation as well to show what it looked like, which I think I have captured reasonably well although it is very difficult to “say” in film with so much whiteness. I have been experimenting with animation techniques for the last 8 years so I knew what I had to do to make the movie look like what I saw. I am self-taught and there is a certain roughness to it because of gaps in my technical knowledge. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))',\n",
       "       'As a child saw lights in the woods and had an encounter with being   I was born in April of 1968 and I think I was about 4-5 upon this happening.  I lived in Oxford, Michigan and for an unknown reason I woke in the middle of the night, I do not know the time, however I was drawn to the window.  I looked out the window and saw a very bright light land in the gravel pit behind my house.  I figure it was about a mile out… Once the bright light landed it did illuminate enough to see a glow in the woods. (Just beyond the dig section of the pit).  I honestly cannot remember how I was drawn, but I was drawn outside.  If I had to guess, I would say it was a \"sound\" or frequency that drew me outdoors.  I remember knowing I was not supposed to be out of bed let alone outside, but was heavily drawn.  Upon entering the backyard, I was greeted by a Being.  It was slightly taller than me with a long neck, oversized head and large oval shaped eyes, long fingers and toes.  The feet were bear, but honestly do not recall clothing.  The overall color of the skin was grey/green.  When I came upon it, it took my hand and we proceeded across the yard to the back fence.  Once I passed the fence into the woods heading out.. I do not recall a thing.  But what I do remember is a feeling of warmth, friendliness and curiosity on both our parts.  I felt no fear and felt hugely curious.  I remember that my feet felt cool and damp and I remember very clearly the sounds of the night, and the feel of the warm yet slightly cool damp air.  There was very little breeze.  It must have been mid to late summer.  I had not thought of that night until I was around 15 or 16 years old when my mother and I went into a book store and I saw the book Communion for the first time.  I started hyperventilating and feeling dizzy and week in the knees as the memory flooded back.  The major difference in looks is that the \"grey\" on the cover of Communion is a sinister looking being, when my experience was much different.  I petty much put the whole thing out of my head and avoided anything regarding Alien abductions, whether it was books or movies for years.  I now feel so far removed from the experience that I am comfortable relating it.  I don’t know what it means or if anything happened or even if it really happened.  Was it possible it was a dream?  I did once talk to a hypnotist when I was in my early 20’s and described my memory to her.  She was a Stop Smoking therapist and did Abduction Hypnotherapy also.  She indicated that based on her experience, my details were too heavy and too much physical memory for it to be just a dream.  She wanted very much for me to follow up with her, but I never did.  I have done very little research, as I was checking out sites on the web I came across you site and decided to throw the information out there and see what came back.  Perhaps this is the time for me to do further investigation on this and determine if it were real or not.  I see that in 1966 there were a number of sightings in Michigan.  However that was years before my time.  So here is your information.  Do with it what you will.  If it ties into other types of reports, perhaps this will be of benefit.  If not, I know that nothing will come from this report. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that date of the event is approximate.  PD))',\n",
       "       'I believe I was abducted by Aliens After walking home from the video store just after dropping off a rented video. I was walking accross Lions park, it is a public park with two softball fields and a playground to the south of the fields. I entered the field heading south accross the park towards my house. the field is about 200 sqaure yards roughly. I decided to sit down at a bench to answer my cell phone. after the call, I looked to the sky, and I saw a bright yellow light, It had come closer and closer until it slid out of clear view behind a tree. The light turned blue, the next thing I remember is waking up 23 minutes later in the middle of the field with a brown blister on the back of my hand inbetween my index finger knuckle and my thumb. I woke up about 30 yards from where i was sitting at the bench. Before I had become unconcious I had taken a picture of the light. Although it was the camera on my phone and its a real poor shot. You can see the yellow light behind the tree. Where the yellow light is, there is no street light or any lamp. I have also taken a picture of the blister after it had popped. Plus after I had regained conciousness I had a slight stomache ache but it wore off soon ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous;  provides no contact information.  PD))',\n",
       "       'San Francisco man, then 22, reported details of 1963 abduction to friend. This is a second party report of a UFO abduction which occurred in about 1963.  The abductee was about 22 years old at the time. He told the story to another person approximately in 1965, who first recounted it to me about two years ago. It is of high interest because the abductee apparently was able to remember the event in extreme detail. He worked as an outside salesman at the time of the abduction event, perhaps the reason he was not noticed as missing by person who knew him. The abductee said he was missing for three days. He described the abductors as being small \"people\" with large heads and large eyes. He considered them to be performing \"medical experiments\" on him. Evidently, he believed the abductors to be able to communicate telepathically, and reported that they conveyed to him that they would be contacting him again every 10 or 15 years. The abductee told the person who reported this story to me that his father owned a drugstore chain in San Francisco. Recently, my source talked to me again about this story, and recalled that he said that his family attended Temple Baptist Church in San Francisco. Evidently, he got married at Temple Baptist Church about in 1966. He was described as being of medium height and slim build, and a Scandanavian ethnic type with blond hair. I am not personally in a position to investigate this story since I do not live in the San Francisco Bay Area anymore or in California at all, but I think a good investigator could make quick work of finding out who this person was.

The memories of the abductions are all  vague as thou they are memories  of dreams. however there are two many surrounding cercomstances to ignore any longer The last incounter I belive was wittnessed by an Ocala FL. Deputy Sherif who stood beside me when the Craft was first observed. I told him to get the ---out of here , \"Unless you want to be a thousand times more freaked out than youve ever been in you life\"  On one ocasion I do recal the alen advising me to forget it, after I had repeatadly told him I would remember it , he  told me :\"If I thought you would remember this I would have to kill you\". However I do  belive that threat was nothing more than a threat. I mention this only to advise you that I do belive the alens have a very precise way of blanking out an exact amount of time from your memory. I don\\'t know why but recently my memories have become much more vivid than they were in the past. The alens look very much like the clasic depection that is widly in cerculation {5\\',  75 lbs , large black eyes . 4 digets per hand) They are however very much human under the skin . There are also anouther type of alen whom I have incountered only once , (3\\' 100 lbs, Blue, ) the little blue men are perhaps the sweetest creatures God has ever created ,very gentle in nature. {If you call me please identify yourself, because normaly I don\\'t want people to think I\\'m crazy so I simply tell them I had a dream of an abduction and leave it at that.} ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the dates of the alleged incidents are approximate.

       "       '2 girls lose track of time while singing \"Octopus\\'s Garden\" and taking a short cut through the woods around a pond after seeing a UFO! On our travels away from my home to my friend\\'s house, we cut through some wooded areas that concealed a barbed wire fence enclosing a compound called Remington Arms. We had done this hundreds of times before, just like all the kids did, but this time we had become frightened while passing through the first woods because of an orange glow which seemed to be illumunating behind some trees in the compound. It was a dry humid summer night, but it smelled strange, like rain or some wierd sweet odor. We started to sing the Beatle\\'s song:\"Octopus\\'Garden\" over & over again as we entered the second section of the dark wooded area. Brushing sounds of branches made us so nervous!  Soon we were at the clearing around the pond and could see the open sky.  We sang a bit louder and tried our best to ignore the orangey glow behind the trees.  I remember that the moon was hanging low and to keep our spirits light we slowly walked along the path toward it and kept on singing.   An object seemed to fly out from inside the Remington Arms compound and we noticed the strange odor in the air again. That wierd sweet odor, but even creepier was the way the tree tops were swaying, especially because there was no wind!   When we had first entered the pond area it felt as if something had been following us from behind the other side of the fence.  My friend was scared and I was too, but acted a bit braver and told her to keep singing and so our voices got louder with nervousness.  As we got closer to the shore of the pond we could see the sky better across the open water.  Suddenly we noticed that it was a triangular shaped ship which appeared without any sound, except for the movement of tree branches brushing together as it emerged from behind some tree tops. The dark triangle cruised directly towards us. It had some bright orange lights and made everything look like a negative film, with that orangey, brown tone. We kept singing, but softer as we couln\\'t believe our eyes. Was this truly a UFO? Time seemed to stand still and must have slipped away because when we finally were able to move away and go down the path, skipping rocks in the strange glow which illuminated our way out of the woods and into the streets, the moon had risen and looked smaller. We hurried to her house as fast as we could and upon arrival everyone was worried. We were three hours late. It was after 11:00 pm and we started out from my house at around 8:00 pm. It was less than a thirty minute walk even with our dilly-dallying!  No-one believed our story and said we each shared an over active imagination. We cried and begged to be believed. \"Call the authorities! We\\'re telling the truth.\" and continued to insist that our experience was real! Then the next day my friend\\'s Dad said, \"Maybe, girls, what you witnessed was only a new aircraft of sometype that the government was testing out. Make sure you both keep away from that area because you\\'ll be caught and convicted of tresspassing!\" Of course, we didn\\'t heed him and went back the next day afterschool. We sang until our lungs turned blue, but no UFO appeared. Later, after supper at my friends house, she decided to only walk me halfway home, the pond would be the \"good-bye\" point. So we sat on rocks in the clearing and began singing Octopus\\' Garden again. Sure enough, the orangey glow hoovered over the moving tree branches and the UFO softly floated above the water once again, not making any sound. This time we were both frozen with fear and disbelief. Again time slipped by, my friend wore a watch, but when we checked it later, it had stopped. She admitted that maybe she forgot to wind it or push the pin in tight enough after setting it. Whatever happened we\\'ll never know? We ran down the path not even skipping the rocks properly. With soaking sneakers and drenched bell-botttoms, we reached the streetlights and fell to our knees in the middle of the road and began to pray! The older kids in the neighborhood started to make fun of us when we told our tale, so we stopped sharing it! One boy who had a tree house  and lived near the pond told everyone that it was true and that he saw the same UFO! We sorta felt better and became closer than ever before. Eventually,though, we kinda stopped talking about it altogether. Soon we became more interested in teenage things, like love, Rock N Roll, and our developing figures. I was always on the skinny side, butd suddenly started to loose a lot of weight. The boy and my best friend fell in love. Soon after my parents moved to the country, I was hospitalized. The Doctors diagnosed me with Hodgekin\\'s Lymphoma. But the pathology report said some nodes had bizarre changes in them which couldn\\'t be identified! Radiation & Chemotherapy took over my young life. I was just turning sixteen. I lost touch with ALL my childhood friends. The last time we got together was in 1984 after our dear friend, who said he also saw the UFO, committed suicide. My best friend was newly engaged to be married, but suspected that she was barren inside, maybe because of our experience. I haven\\'t seen or spoke to her since. However,I was able to give birth to twin girls in 1986 and in March of 96 or 1997 during the visit of Hale-Bopp Comet, I had bizarre dreams of being abducted and woke up with tiny needle marks on the veins in my right hand. My daughters both had nightmares! One of them saw me on a table in a white room. I couldn\\'t beleve it when she told me that these aliens took her arm off and she saw them doing painful things to her twin sister. I told them that I had a visit too and showed them my hand. I had two tiny unexplainable scabs directly on my veins. I chose not to tell them until later in adulthood that I saw them in the white lights too, and in my dream I also saw that same daughter laying on a table without her arm. God\\'s honest truth! To this day the twins become uncomfortable talking about it. They don\\'t like to remember the bad experience and say that I am making up my admissions just to scare them. I wonder...can generations become targets of study? ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))',\n",
       "       'Nightime visitation in Connecticut-1973; this was a probable abduction. When I was seven years old I had a terrifying experience that I kept to myself for weeks and was unable to sleep at night and refused to go my bedroom at night.  My parents had to let me fall asleep in the den with them and they would then carry me up to my room.  Upon finally talking to them about what was worrying me their reaction was almost as scary as the original event.  When I spoke of this with them they turned ghostly pale and seemed very stressed- although my mother did manage to muster out that it must have been \"just a dream.\"  \\tOne night in the summer of\\'73, I woke to find two small grey beings standing in my bedroom looking at me. (This was before any mention of, or description of, alien abductions had been put on T.V. or in the movies-to my knowledge at that time, anyway.)  The beings could not have been much taller than 4 feet, they had very large almond shaped black eyes, they were slender and their mouths were just slits.  One of the beings walked towards me and spoke to me telepathically. I could not move and I was clearly very fearful. I asked him if he was a Martian and he said, no, but you are right that we are from another planet.  I don’t remember much that happened after that, but I do remember looking towards the hallway (my door was open and the hall light was on), and I saw my father being carried out by several of the small beings out of the hall and down into the stairwell.  The only other memory of this event- which is slightly detached-is that I remember a different being, slightly larger but with the same large eyes, hovering over me, telling me that they wont hurt me and then forcing me to drink some white liquid that had the appearance of milk but had a horrible chemical taste. \\tDuring my subsequent years I think I chose to forget this traumatic experience. But one day when I was in my late teens I was walking past a bookstore and saw a display of Whitley Streiber’s book \"Communion.\"  When I saw that  face on the cover of the book I went into a cold sweat and had a panic attack.  It took several months to get up the courage to purchase that book and read it. These memories then came back to me.  I have not pursued hypnotherapy to reveal any further truths, simply because I really don’t think I want to know-not yet anyway.  I swear to you that this really did happen.

       "       \"Here's my case I rerported to Nuforc.org. It's horribly written so I'll rewrite it here to tell more of the details.  It was not hunting season like Nuforc added, and I could find a more accurate date if I found court dates of a custody hearing, because it happened a week or two before that date around 1996. (link to my case at bottom)  -----------------------  My story;  I lived in a travel camper about 100 feet from my parents house on their property which adjoined my grandparents property at the bottom of a mountain, Virginia, in Roanoke. There was a field 8 acres in size between my parent's and grandparent's homes. One night, it was getting late around 11 p.m., I started hearing some dogs bark (we had no dog, it must have been neighbors in a distance) and went to look out of the tiny window in the back side of the camper and across the field. I saw a light in the woods about 200 feet down from my grandparent's home (on my grandparent's property). It was going around a tree and stayed in the same place the whole time. The family sometimes let a hunter racoon/squirrel hunt? so I wondered if it could be him. After watching several minutes, the light went out. I went back and looked a few minutes later and it was back on, but soon went out again. I left, came back, and each time the light would be on and go off when I looked and kept doing this in sinc with me watching or not like it was playing a game. Then suddenly a red light shot up out of the woods and over the ridge (like a flare?) Then nothing. I left the window again.  This was a little disturbing, so after a few minutes I had to go look again. There was a HUGE triangular craft headed from the direction where the flare was toward the field. It was going VERY slowly and low. It was totally dark, no interior lights, and no normal exterior lights except one long red light that went completely from front to back of the craft. It's flying altitude stayed below that of the mountain peak. It took a long time to go from over the field, to the peak and when it reached the peak, it went beside it and behind it. Then it seemed (later realized a much smaller craft) to circle behind the peak and come back around the other side of it and it started coming back down the mountain in the direction of my house. This scared me so I grabbed a handgun I kept for protection, and went outside to watch it.  There were no exterior lights on this craft coming toward me, and there was a light inside lit up like a cockpit. It was barely skimming the tree tops as it made it's way down the mountainside. When it got about 200 ft. from my home, it stopped and turned it's interior light off. I could see this one was about the size of a helicopter. It then traveled over to my backyard and hovered just a few feet directly over a light pole. It shone a big spotlight down in the yard, which I was standing just on the outside of.  I panicked and ran as fast as I could to my parents house next door. When I looked back, I saw no signs of it still being there. I went inside and woke my parents up, telling them what had just happened.  Suspicious facts; There is no way a human could see me in this tiny window from such a far distance, without having binoculars, telescope and intentionally keeping a lookout for people watching. These crafts made NO noise. I did not have any missing time (in case anyone wondered about possible abduction, no it didn't happen). But, I am left feeling very angry and violated that whoever, whatever, this was did trespass on private property, on the ground in the woods, as well as flying under the allowed altitude according to government regulations. Military, alien? I don't know. I do know this technology is either secret military, or alien in nature. I have searched since then to compare and identify it, and I have not been able to identify it still. The closest thing I've seen is from a UFO story on t.v. of some people in Australia who had an encounter with a huge triangular craft with a long red light.  I called the Roanoke airport the following week and asked them if anything strange showed up on their radar the previous week. They just laughed at me and then told me no.  Here's my Nuforc report;  http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/016/S16107.html  10/15/96 23:00 Roanoke VA Triangle 1 hour I saw a triangular craft with only red light from front to back on it. Craft stopped over my back yard and shone light down. 2/18/01 ------------------ Note to Nuforc;  There is nothing in those woods. Just plain trees! It doesn't matter if you contact me or not, even though I checked at bottom of form. It's just that if anyone wants to go onto the land and check for radiation, or whatever, or if anyone wants to meet me and go to the area this happened at, I can arrange that. I do not want to say publicly it was at the bottom of Bent Mountain, because I do not want to be identified publicly and some locals might know it's me with that much information put in there. I don't care to investigate for my own purposes, but only if you think you might gain some helpful knowledge or if Nuforc could benefit in some way by doing so. I also hope you don't give our information out to the government, as that worries me the government might hurt or harrass people if they are doing secret operations and people are telling about it. Thank you for your time. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))\",\n",

Saw a saucer hovering over the, then Hebrew Congregation on Lockwood Drive.  The saucer seemed to idle for a few minutes then it jetted off in a split second.  It was less than a 100 yds from me, as clear as day.  The saucer was your typical dull silver color with green lights circling the outer rim.  My cousin and I were both 13 the spring of 1977, I remember this day clearly, because we were getting ready to go for Easter Sunday Service and we were standing on the 4th floor balcony of the, then El Dorado Towers.  The Synagogue is approximately 100 yards from the building, at arms length the saucer appeared as big as a football field (100yds).  By the time I realized what was happening I told my cousin to run inside and get my camera, but the saucer disappeared in a split second.  My cousin and I couldn’t believe what had just happened, and being we were just kids we were afraid to tell our parents in fear of being labeled out of our minds.  Till this day we still don’t talk about the incident, because it freaked us out.  I remember telling my cousin that maybe they had heard us mention we were going to a picture, and they zipped off instead.  I think that we always felt as they had heard us, and therefore we were afraid of saying anything, in fear of getting abducted.',\n",
       "       'Cedar Rapids Iowa   blue lights hovering in the shape of a \"V\" with no sound and two witnesses My friend and I were going to stay in a tent on my parents property. I do not specifically recall the year, I know within a 3 year range, but could not possibly ever recall the exact date because neither my friend nor I made a record of the observation.  My friend and I were contemplating leave the tent because the air was getting cold as the evening progressed. We unzipped tent entrance which faced to the East. I poked my head out and immediately noticed the apparent lights which couldn\\'t have been anything produced by human beings. Without moving, I told my friend to poke his head out to observe the site and he saw the exact same thing as I did.  We noticed lights in a \"V\" shape with the point being closest to us. Since this at night, it\\'s impossible to judge both the distance above the ground and distance of the lights/craft but they \"appeared\" to be within 2 miles of the surface and over 1/2 of a mile in length. These lights were blue in color. I believe there were either 7 or 9 lights, I do not recall, but they were in a perfect \"V\" shape. The lights were shining down towards the surface, with the closest one almost directly above us, but they didn\\'t light up whatever they were attached to. These could have been separate crafts in a perfect \"V\" shape or just one craft with all the lights on them, but you couldn\\'t see above the lights. The front of the \"V\" was pointing towards the North. The rear of the lights stretched far away from the front. The lights appeared to be perfectly spaced out from one another with thousands of feet in between them. Thousands of feet is more-than-likely an understatement, but again it would be impossible to tell in the dark, especially with it being up in the sky at an undermined altitude.  There was absolutely no sound coming from the light sources and no movement either. They appeared to hover in place throughout the entire duration of the siting. We were both afraid we had been spotted and didn\\'t know if it were possible for us to be harmed so we didn\\'t run, move, or anything except quietly whisper on infrequent occasion. I believe 10 minutes had passed before we felt safe enough to duck inside the tent. We discussed what we had seen to make sure our stories were identical and not fictitious. We both agreed going into my parents\\' house was the best decision because staying in the tent wouldn\\'t give us the safety we felt we needed. At this time, we were unsure if we were going to be abducted, left alone, or have any other insane experience because seeing the UFO was astonishing, so at this point, we felt anything was now a possibility.  After 5 minutes of discussion, we grabbed our pillows and looked out again prior to making a dash for the house. We slowly poked our heads out and were both amazed to notice the lights were not there, or not on, one of two cases. I didn\\'t think they could have been off, my assumption was they had vanished, but I suppose they could have just been off. The thought never entered my mind until typing this recount of the events. No sound was ever heard and the massive array of lights were not seen again. We ran into the house and told my parents about it. They didn\\'t doubt we believed what we saw, however, they had never seen anything like what we described and didn\\'t know if any possible explanation was possible other than a UFO. At least 9 years have passed before I wrote this recount of the events. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))',\n",

When I was 17 years old, I awoke in my underwear running from a bright light in my backyard. I was terrified. Next I awoke in my bed and vividly remembered running from the light.  I thought it was just a nightmare and went back to sleep.  The next day I woke up and looked at my watch that I had on been wearing overnight and realized that I was late for school.  I hurried and got dressed and rushed to school only to find that I was ~45 minutes early.  I thought nothing of it.  During my first period class, the girl that sat in the desk behind me asked me what day it was.  I told her the date and someone beside me said I was wrong. My watch was a day ahead.  This would not be strange except that I clearly remembered her asking me what day it was the day before the event and the date on my watch was correct.  Still I did not think about my nightmare, nor did I suspect anything more than a malfunctioning watch.  After school I returned to my home.  When I walked in my mom was in the kitchen.  I talked to her for a few minutes and told her about my day. Then she said something that chills me to the bone to this day.  She asked me if I saw a bright light out my window last night. She said the light woke her up and she wasn't real sure what it was and then it went away.  The window to her bedroom was on the same side of the house that I was on while running from the bright light. Our house is 100 yards from the road and our driveway is on the opposite side of the house.  I am not sure what happened to me, but I have a feeling that I may have been abducted.

       "       '1997 Santa fe, MN A enormous \"metropolis\" looking ship landing and our memories wiped away, lost time   I am not exactly sure this is the right date or month but I am certain it was spring of 1997.  I was outside my college dormitory and we were having a school event.  I am Native American and we were having a drum and dance social event.  I was singing with the other singers when one of the drummers pointed to the northwest and said “Oh my god! Look at that!”  I turned and looked it was night time out when I turned and looked I thought we would be crushed in a few seconds by the enormous ship we saw.  It seemed to be landing.  It was so enormous I can only say that it looked like a large metropolis landing.   It made no sound but had a strange energy that you could “sense or feel”.  It had millions of little lights all over it and in many colors.  It was like a city because it was not a uniform shape.  It had many appendages and parts to it.  It was so big it seemed to nearly block out that part of the sky.  I was standing there and just complete shock hit me.  That is all I remember.  When we “came to” or became conscious again I felt dazed and like the memory of it was fading so quickly that I had to meditate quickly to hold it in my mind.  Everyone else seemed to just go back to what they were doing and when I tried to get them to talk about it or even come with me to go search for it, they seemed like zombies.  At the time I was pregnant, I don’t know if that was a factor in how I might have been treated if we were abducted or if our minds were manipulated at all.  I was a peer counselor at the time at the schools student drop in center “The Healing Circle”.  I ran A.A. meetings and held traditional “Talking Circles” for the Native students who needed support emotionally and we had our own licensed Psychologist on staff as well.  He was standing right next to me and witnessed this too. I believe we lost some time too. He was the only one who wanted to go running after this thing.  I eventually convinced some friends who were not there to witness it to take me to look for it.  We rode around in the car for a bout two hours.  We couldn’t find anything and it should have been right on top of us if! it was going to really land anyway.  While we were driving around we did see military jets circling the area for quite awhile.  I believe people called the radio stations and 911 too.  I can’t confirm that though.  The strangest thing was that I did forget the incident for about 5 years I could not remember it.  One day I was working with some youth, I am now a social worker, we were driving toward Minneapolis’s downtown and we could see the skyline.  We were talking about strange things like Bigfoot and UFO’s when suddenly the memory came flooding back instantly.  I was overwhelmed and that same shocked feeling came over me. I still don’t remember what happened though between the times I saw it landing and then the next second “poof!” it was just gone, completely vanished.  I have never reported this before.  I found this website and thought it was time to tell the story.  I have looked online for a picture of a UFO that would be similar to what I saw but I haven’t.  I am Native American and my tribe believes in Aliens completely.  I do too, especially now. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))',\n",
       "       \"The truth behind the Grays   This is a recounting of an abduction experience I've hade about 6 years ago.  Nobody knows about it, or the other countless abductions I've had for as long back as I remember.  The first time I remember there being quiet bright lights in the sky above the back yard.  I felt this strong urge to go outside and check it out. and when I did, they took me.  And they've been taking me ever since.  Sometimes they'd come for me, other times they called me and I would have no choice but to them.  I did tell my parents about it once, as a little kid, around 6 years old, when the Greys left me in my living room insted of dropping me back in my bedroom.  They blamed it on sci-fi movies and videogames and I got yelled at for making up stories.  That was the only time I tried to tell anyone.  When I moved from home into my appartment, I slept with a 9mm. under my pillow for months, but I was always paralised when they would come for me, so that idea was a bust.  Setting up video cameras in my bedroom proved ineffective as well.  In the morning, the tapes would be blank, like I never set them to record at all.  And after a while, the fear dissapeared from the abductions and I started to accept that getting pulled out of my room on random nights was just something I'd have to deal with. One night in July of 2001, I was abducted.  It seemed business as usual.  I was called to the room of my apartment and then the flash filled my eyes, and when it cleared, I was laying on the table again.  The grays usually planted dozens of accupuncture type needles in my chest, stomach, neck.  Rarely they would insert a tube into my ear or throat which was quite painful.  This time was the tube in my throat.  As the machine was being prepared, several of the grays seemed to rushin from another room.  They spoke to the ones about to experiment on me, and they all ran from the room.  I felt a rumble in the table I was laying on and heard a loud explosion, followed by what seemed to be weapons fire.  Several minuets passed and then a tall, armored figure wearing a blank faced mask entered the room, carrying a type of weapon, resembeling an assault rifle.  The figure removed the mask to reveal a very canine like face, with bright orange eyes, covered by short, blue fur.  The usual abduction experience was frightening, but seeing this new creature made me feel like my heart would beat out of my chest.  The being leaned over the instrument table the grays kept their tools on and began touching the objects there.  Suddenly I could move again. The creature came over to me and gently helped me into a sitting position on the table. Then, in plane English, asked if I was alright.  I told her(I say 'her' because the voice of the being sounded most definitely female to me) yes and asked what was happening. I rose from the table, and she led me from the exam room.  Outside the room, in the large halls of the ship, there were dead bodies of grays around every corner.  Creatures like her, and several other new strange creatures were at control panles and moving about the ship.  The creature introduced herself at this point as Boudica(boo-dee-ca) and told me that this ship was going to be destroyed.  I asked her why and what was going on.  She then exlained to me something I never thought of in all the time I was being abducted:  The grays, in reality were a cybernetic lifeform created by Boudica's race and more than 3 dozen other races in contact with each other on the other side of the Milky Way.  Centuries ago, they formed a union with each other to establish trade, travel and the discovery of new lifeforms across the universe. However, space travle was a long, difficult affair.  So these large, strong alien races created the small, weak looning grays as sort of advanced scouts, used to seek out, examine and greet new intelegent lifeforms as they found it. They gray body design was chosen because the alien union thought that body shape the least threatening. They in general being tall and muscular, they couldn't see the gray body type being a threat to anyone. As I proceded through the ship, I noticed gray bodis being carried through the hall, some in peices.  And sure enough, in the open wounds of the grays there were servos, wires and components I could not identify in my limited experience.  Boudica took me to a room filled with several other large aliens.  One alien, an 8 foot tall being who appeared to have a reptilian face with a feathery red crest around its head, asked how long they grays had been taking me.  I told him(?) the last 15 years and he apoligised to me for all the pain and trouble I've been through. Then he promised me I'd never have to go through any of that again. Boudica told me I'd have to be put to sleep to be transported back to my appartment, because they didn't fully understand the methods the grays used to teleport people from place to place.  She took a long rod like instrument from the control panle and waved it once in front of my face.  That is the last I remembered from the gray ship. It has been more than 6 years since I've been abducted. I've tried to make sense of the events on the gray's ship tha night. As far as I can figure, they grays were supposed to be a scouting party to survey newly discovered intelegent races in secret. For whatever reason, they failed their mission, and would not stop abducting people and experimenting on them. So, the ALien union who created them is now in the process of finding and destroying them. It is my beliefe that whe the Ailen union finally destroys the threat to Earth posed by the grays, then they might finally make their existence known to humanity and induct us into their collection of races across the universe.

       "       \"The Black Triangle Over Thornapple Ln. My brother and i were playing up stairs waiting for our dad to get home from down state. My brother was 7 and i was 9. The rest of the family was downstairs in the guest bedroom. My dad rode a motercylce when he traveled by himself and it was really loud. Anyway, we played up stairs for a good 20 minutes when i thought that i heard my dad coming into the driveway, but the wierd thing was that i didnt hear his bike but i thought he was home. When i looked out the living room window i didnt see anything but the triangular black ufo caught my attention. It was flying right over our house almost touching it. It also made no sound. I called to my brother to look and when he did he was just ammazed. We were both actually. At the time we only thought it was a plane cause we didnt know about UFO'S and Aliens. It was flying like it had no speed at all. As it flew over the house we ran to the back window to look at it. The tip of the craft was out of sight already. After not too long we just let it go as a plane and went on playing agian. I didnt really get into UFO's untill a few years ago. Thats when i actually remembered that day and asked my brother about it. For some strange reason he has trouble talking about it, as if he wants to deny that day in all. He is a pretty to-himself kinda guy now. As for me, a while back i didnt soemthing really stupid as a dumb teenager that changed my life. Ill come forward and say that i smoked something that i wasnt suppost to. It was marijuana, but something was wrong with it i guess cause till this day i have panic attacks and just think really weird. It almost seemed like it opened a door in my head that i can't close. Im married now with a wonderful woman and family. Im more open to the unknown and can now except the fact that we arent alone anymore. I can say that i know more about life now then anyone should, or atleast i think i do. After that stupid thing happend to me, i feel that that day with the UFO had something to do with MY way of life. Like i somethimes believe that i could have been abducted cause i think i had missing time that day. Anyway, there is so much more to my life after that day then i should write. thanks for reading.

       "       \"U.F.O. sighting which is unknown to me what I was seeing but it was very bright and round like the moon. I was not abducted but when we lived in Texas near Dyess Air Force Base my son (who was about 7 years old the year was I believe 1994) we were sitting on our front porch at 20 Field Street in Clyde, Texas.  It was about midnight a hot evening and we sat out most evenings to star gaze.  This particular night I was not really paying attention to much except the cool night air but my little boy looked up by the moon and he said Mamma whats that?   I looked in the direction he stared and saw a brilliant white ball of light (ovulating?  Words to describe it are like it bobbed up and down and swayed like a staggering drunk)  ((oscillating??  PD)) and it made its way past the moon and just under it then in a flash it propelled itself upwards extremley fast and dissapeared.  I don't know what it was but never have I ever seen what I saw that night and not since have I. I only ever saw one that did this in the skies in Clyde but it was not a brilliant ball of light but rather a small white light that when it propelled upwards it looked like a tail of flames coming from it (a meteor perhaps?).  My father was visiting that summer and he saw it.  I remember when we moved to Clyde our neighbors said there were strange lights in the skies but whatever it was it sparks my interest in finding out what it may be.   I hope you understand why I will not leave my real name. There is never any way to prove what my son and I saw that night but I asked him if he remembered and he said he does.  It's been a long time ago and we moved to PA now.  Delete my information if you will but I just thought I would share what I saw.  Take it or leave it.  Sorry I do not have Microsoft Word only notepad.\",\n",
       "       'Triangular, quiet, extremely slow-moving craft sighted around Charleston, SC. Today, July 24, 2007, I was reading through articles posted on www.fark.com.  One of the links was to a UK Daily Mail article titled “UFO sighting bring town to a standstill”  (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=470579&in_page_id=1770),  about a UFO sighting over Stratford-Upon-Avon.  What immediately struck me in the article was the picture at the top, which made me think \"I\\'ve seen this before.\"  A friend and I once witnessed a very similar triangular aircraft flying around the area of Charleston, SC, in summer 2004.  This drove me to look into how many others have seen what I saw.  I figured I’d find one or two stories, not the hundreds that can be found that describe the same thing that I remember. I don\\'t believe in encounters with aliens or anything like that; I think it\\'s obvious the distances across space are far too great for such a thing to happen.  Despite that, or perhaps because of that, this event had struck me as being very strange, and has left a strong memory of what I would usually dismiss as someone “seeing things”. I\\'m not sure the exact month when it happened.  It was during the summer of \\'04.  A friend and I who were going to school at the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command in Goose Creek, SC, decided to go out and get some late night Waffle House.  My friend was doing the driving, as I don\\'t have a license.  Perhaps if I drove more I\\'d remember the exact locations better, but I don\\'t.  You don’t remember driving directions well when you don’t drive.  Looking at the area\\'s Waffle House locations on Google Earth, I figure it was most likely the one on Goose Creek Blvd, or perhaps the one on Aviation Rd near the Charleston Airport, which is also very close to the Charleston Air Force Base. Well, we ate our Waffle House.  Afterwards, we figured we had time to waste.  It was probably a Friday or Saturday night or something.  We didn’t know the area well as we were only there a short time for the school, and our spare time was usually spent within the city of Charleston.  So, we went exploring. We weren\\'t more than 5 miles away from one of those two Waffle Houses.  We took a turn onto a long, straight, wide, smooth road.  It seemed to be a strange road.  I know I\\'d never seen it during the day.  There was a little traffic on the road we came off of, but none on this one.  It was wide, 6 lanes if I remember right.  It looked like it was freshly paved.  The street we came off of was in the open, but this one had the forest close in on both sides, I\\'d estimate within 10ft of the road.  The trees were tall on both sides, probably 20-30ft, or a little higher.  It would give me the impression of a planted forest since they were all about the same height, but you can\\'t really tell at night.  We couldn\\'t see the end of the road in sight, the road in front of us was the only break in the trees, for the whole length of the road.  No other roads turned off that we ever saw.  The street was completely unlit, except for our truck\\'s headlights.  I don’t remember if there were any markings or signs at the intersection that stated the purpose of the road.  There were no signs whatsoever during the length (a couple miles) of the road.  The road turned out to end in a military base, which makes the lack of identification of the road confusing, though it explains it’s otherwise spartan appearance. We were driving down the road no more than a minute, when my friend pointed out some lights above the trees to the left.  I can\\'t remember if there were 3 or 4 lights when we first saw it.  There were definitely 3 white lights (not \\'glows\\' as I\\'ve read some people as seeing) at the 3 points of the triangle.  We slowed down the truck to about 5-10mph so we could get a better look at it.  It quickly became clear that what we were looking at was no commonplace aircraft. I remember trying to determine if I could see a shape of the aircraft, and vaguely thinking I saw a darker (black against the midnight blue sky) shape against the sky.  It had reminded me of a nacho chip, with a light at each of it’s points. Next I noticed how slow it seemed to be moving.  It gave me the impression of being low-flying and extremely slow.  (I can’t understand how people are claiming that these flying triangles they see are at 1000ft and going 30 knots, etc.  How can you tell from the ground at what height it is, and how large it is?  You can’t really tell if it’s 170ft wide and 100ft off the ground, or a mile wide and 50 miles off the ground.  At least I couldn’t tell in the dark of that night…)  It made me think of something like a B-2, but if it was only 170ft wide, or however wide they are, then it must have been almost unmoving.  I know few aircraft we have can hover, and a B-2 sure ain’t one of them. Then my friend pointed out something that should have been far more obvious – it was very quiet, perhaps silent.  We couldn’t hear any discernible sound over his little Toyota truck.  This later made us think that it could have been a much larger craft higher up, but that seems less likely.  While an extremely large craft could appear to be moving slowly and be silent if it were orbiting the Earth in our upper atmosphere at high speeds, the idea of some Independence Day-sized aircraft remaining undetected by everyone on the planet seems unlikely, not to mention the absurdity of such a design. The next part is still what strikes me as the strangest.  It reminded me of the old stories and movies of a beam of light coming out of a flying saucer to abduct people.  In the center of the craft there was what appeared to be a searchlight, one of those directional beams of light used to illuminate specific parts of a landscape.  I don’t remember the light first turning on specifically, and I don’t remember it being there when we first saw the craft.  The reason I stated that there were 3 or 4 lights at the start is I figure if it had the searchlight on from the start I would have noticed it a lot quicker, but the clear image planted in my brain is that of the flying triangle with the 3 lights, and the one searchlight in the center.  It was being directed around apparently randomly, like you’d see one being used in a prison escape movie to search for an escapee.  The beam could be seen moving quickly and erratically, but smoothly, over the forest, and it occasionally passed over the road we were on, as well, but it never really got close to the truck.  We were still moving slowly down the road with our truck, and the craft was still passing slowly above us.  I couldn’t help thinking at that time that whatever piece of magnificent technology that had to be, that they must have known we were there.  But if it did know we were there, it didn’t give any indication of it. We kept looking at it in awe as we crept down the road, it eventually being above us and to the left, so that my friend was sticking his head out the driver’s side window, and I was looking straight up at the dashboard.  It slowly passed us, or we passed it; whatever happened, it was behind us.  Not much farther down the road we spotted the trees straight ahead that marked the end of the road.  The road split off to the right side, and I think to the left as well.  I remember the right side more clearly for some reason.  There was an empty guardhouse to the right of a small 2-lane road, which had 2 or 3 large yellow-painted pylons staggered along the lanes to keep anyone from flying through.  I’d swear I remember a sign to the right side of that road, on the side of the guardhouse, which declared it as an Army something-or-another.  It didn’t seem strange to me at the time, but my searching indicates no army bases in the area.  Not even abandoned ones, which would explain the empty guardhouse. Well, we turned the truck around and started heading back, about 30-40 seconds after passing the aircraft.  The aircraft was gone.  Just like that.  We heard no sound that indicated any type of engine speeding up, or any aerodynamic noise, or anything.  It was just gone. We talked about it as we drove back to our Navy base.  We figured it was some sort of experimental military craft.  All the branches of the military were represented in Charleston, except for the Army, as far as we could tell… except for that sign that I still remember seeing.  We joked that we’d probably be assassinated in our sleep by the CIA for seeing something we weren’t supposed to.  It still doesn’t make sense to me why they would fly such a craft over a populated area we were in.  Admitted the exact place was a thick forest, civilization wasn’t very far away. That had remained sitting in the back of my mind – the time I saw that crazy experimental military aircraft – until I read that article today.  It didn’t make sense to me.  The picture I see there looks just like what I saw, through from a lot farther away, but it’s in the UK.  Why would experimental US military aircraft be flown in across the ocean?  They could be participating in it, but that doesn’t make sense.  It’s the American policy to share our old technologies, not our new ones.  Not to mention, the searchlight?  What was that?  With such advanced technology, it seems like a pretty archaic means of trying to find things at night, and not a very stealthy one.  I don’t think we even use beams of light any more for weapons targeting, and we’ve got much better ways of communications than using lights.  Makes no sense to me, but it was there.  Oh, and unlike those stories, it was definitely a clear, white light, like the 3 at the corners, except that it was a directed beam as opposed to a simple light.  It definitely wasn’t red. I place this event as taking less than four minutes, though I can\\'t really tell for sure.  It\\'s not like I was counting the time on my watch.  My best guess was it was 1:30am. Well, that’s all the story I have.  I’m no UFO expert, or even a military aircraft expert, but I know what I saw wasn’t anything the government will admit to having at their disposal.

Out of the light came two  alien aircrafts. Another flash of light came and there was two new \"UFOs\". It continued like that until it was 8-10 crafts. The crafts that i saw were the same as the ones that got me last year. The crafts were triangles with something looking like a big window on it. Last year I thought I was dreaming, but now I know the truth. I was alien abducted last year. I have been researching on this now and it was \"the grays\" that abducted me.

       "       'UFO Sighted In Millhurst IL  I do not know how true this is but I have been hearing lots second hand stories from other people about an incident that had occurred over in Silver Springs State Park in Kendall County IL. I’ve been hearing this ongoing story throughout at my work placement at my job, people on the buses and commuter trains and even at the bar that I go to every so often. Everybody that I’ve seen or heard were talking about the missing woman from Plainfield IL as everyone had referred it as a UFO abduction that had kidnap the Plainfield woman over at Silver Springs State Park.  This story event is about a UFO sighting taken place in some small town called Millhurst IL. Which is right next to Silver Springs State Park in Kendall County. Something about a 38-year-old mother who had taken a walk into the woods and mysteriously disappears, vanish in mid air without a trace. One evening I was scanning around on my short-wave radio station on the AM band at around 1340 KHz, I heard a small radio station which is talk-show radio program where people were calling in to this station and saying that they’ve seen this large disc shaped object with multi colored lights on it, as it was passing through Millhurst IL as it was heading towards Silver Springs State Park in Kendall County IL.  One person who called into this small town radio station said that this object appears to have multi color lights and it was changing all different colors. Another person had called into the radio station and said the he was camping out at Silver Springs State Park, and saw this saucer disk shaped like object hovered towards the southwest for about 20 minutes, and then this saucer shape object had shot down a white laser beam as if it was looking for something, then it just took off way up into the sky.  Other phone calls had came pouring into this little radio station, in fact one person had said that she had seen from a distant had saw a young woman walking alone into the woods area, as this saucer shape object had a white laser beam had shot at this woman, as she vanish right into mid air without a trace.  I do not know if this radio station was telling the truth or making this as a phony story, by making a mountain out of a molehill? Whatever the case may be, I heard that this radio station is mostly half-fiction and half-truth, but everybody that I had run into at work on the buses and trains; just keep on talking about this strange UFO incident.',\n",

       "       '((NUFORC Note:  We are uncertain whether this report is submitted as a serious-minded account of a genuine event.  However, we post it, nevertheless.  Date is approximate.  PD)) Bright light shining with 4 lizard-like beings approaching. Late at night in the mid-summer month of July I was awakened by a very intense bright light shining from the back side of the house that I grew up in.  I was accustumed to seeing bright head lights from the railroad trains as they approached my dads property from the town of Grand Blanc.  But, this time there was no deisel engines roaring and the light never faded as would when the trains passed by the property.   I could see this really bright light coming from the other side of the house and in order to really see it I had to go down stairs and look out the back porch door.  When I did this I was so blinded by this light that I had to cover my eyes and that is when I saw them.   A small group of four short, very stout, Dark-skinned, weird looking....almost a dark purple or navy blue color Lizard-like beings. It felt like a circus or carnival coming right at me,no! Coming for me! I freaked and went inside in a sort of strange dream-like panic and desperately needed to hide somewhere. I could not think and quickly just layed down on one of our families picnic benches that we used for feeding the large number of siblings that I grew up with. I tried to imagine that I was invisible and turned myself into a bench, for I was only 9 years old at the time. They came inside and as a group picked me up and carried me away. I was paralyzed by some kind of hand held instrument and it all just seemed like some sort of carnival-like dream. When I regained what I thought was my consciousness there I was laying on that bench still. It was just starting to turn a tad bit light outside and I went back upstairs and went back to sleep. Later that summer I started having night scares and an intense fear of sleeping in my own bedroom. I did everything I could to spend the rest of the summer at my nephews home; we were close in age and I simply had no recollection of this experience, until I was a teenager and started having this exact re-occuring dream. For the longest time that is what I considered it to be, just! a reall y strange dream. Until I saw the movie,\"communion\"! The creatures were just like the ones they described visually in that flick! And then many years later my sister told me she saw them carry me out the door. We both have had to deal with this peculiar sense of being abducted and violated through some vague sense that we suffered through some ordeal. I believe that they zap you with this instrument to prevent  terror shock from killing us! Realizing this has in no way made my life any easier. It has been a burden on my psyche and self will. There are/were peculiar psycological and behavioral problems that I feel have stemmed from this occurence/disturbance in my childhood. I would sleep under my bed, seizures from out of no-where. Doctors probed my brain to see if I had epilepsy. An asthmatic condition would strike if I was suddenly spooked or surprised. To this day I still struggle with what happened.

       "       '1978 Atlantic Ocean Sighting \"While around 90 miles off the eastern coast of Georgia on board a military vessle that was stationary in the water giving a foreign freighter needed fuel, a contact appeared on the radar scope that was verified as a \"true echo\" as well as not a craft that is from the United States or an allied nation. This echo was showing up at 900 feet altitude which is the exact height that the surface search radar ends & the air search radar begins. As the echo faded from the surface search radar it began appearing brilliantly on the air-search radar, then vise versa. Around 10 minutes later, upon exiting the radar room to go outside for a possible visual, it was immediately noticed that it had become quite foggy outside! Visibility was less than 50 feet! Yet, the last weather observation was low humidity, 74 degrees and calm wind!  It was at that point that previous books read pertaining to U.F.O.\\'s, sightings, abductions, etc. became the thinking while going to the port-side of the ship.( In one abduction case written about, the author had written about how aliens went about preparing the abductees for viewing what was to be a sort of weather show that the aliens were about to conduct). Upon arriving to the port side of the ship & looking upward about 45 degrees towards the baring the echo showed on the radars, it was witnessed that within the fog was a diamond shaped object that was showing various colors like that of a gem was seen. There was no sound whatsoever coming from the object, nor was it moving. Once atop the bridge (called flying bridge), a \\'bolted-to-the-deck\\' double lens telescope was swung towards the objects direction. Once focused onto the object, one could see what was the outline of what appeared to be the window area of a saucer or ship. The various lights emitted from this craft seemed to come from all areas except for the windows area. The windows area appeared as a dark tinted set of windows, and that there seemed to be motions coing from inside the glass though one couldn\\'t get a very clear view through the tinted glass along with the fog that was drifting past the windows in waves. The windows area appeared to be angling downward towards the ship, the bottom pointed end of the craft appeared to be slanted back while the pointed top appeared to be pointing forward as was the tinted windows just below the top point of this craft. It was decided to go back to the radar room to attempt to get further data established without alerting any officer or crewmate. Once back inside the radarroom, the echo was still appearing on either the surface search or the air search radars. It was then that it was decided that this craft is aware of the radars antenna\\'s \\'beamwidths\\'!  The width between the two antennas is mere feet but enough that if a craft has the ability to trace the ships electrical output from those antennas that craft could in fact hide between the two radar antennas without being detected. The good thing was that this craft was not completely successful in hiding itself completely either with the heavy fog nor between the beam-widths of the two antennas. As minutes passed, it was noticed that this echo began to move!  This echo was plotted during 3 complete sweeps from the air-search radar (set at 350 miles). After the 3rd sweep  the echo disappeared completely off the radar screen! The results of the 3 plotted marks were; 1. Altitude 1000 feet, speed 400 knots, 2. altitude over 15,000 feet, speed est. near 800 knots, 3. Altitude surpassing 50,000 feet, speed est. over 5000 knots!   It was then decided to go back outside for any further visual possible. Once outside, there was no fog whatsoever present, the sky was completely clear with the sun shining which was the precise weather just before the contact had first appeared on either radar screen!   As for the name of the military vessle, any other witnesses, etc., it has been kept annonymous. Though noone on board the ship was alerted to this sighting, others did notice and it was talked about by fellow radar operators, crewmates, etc. for days to come afterwards. The above information is of fact to the best of ones knowledge, and is in no way a hoax or the like. Also, this report is not the 1st sighting ever seen by oneself. Another sighting can be traced back to either 1966 or 1967 during the summer which was located 60 miles north of Albany NY & was printed in a small column in the local newspaper there (Post Star). Footnote; there are other details of the ocean sighting that were omitted due to protecting witnesses as well as oneself. As for the possibility of being sworn to secrecy, one could say that it was a good possibilty. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

A saucer shaped craft came an hovered over my friends backyard where some 20 plus people were playing frisbee, volleyball, touch football and enjoying a hearty cookout. The craft came down and landed in my friend\\'s backyard. a door opened and two tall, slender gray colored, about 6\\'2\" and about 6\\'4\" beings, came out and floated across the yard. The crowd panicked and backed away. My friend\\'s mother ran out of the house screaming for everyone to get back. My friend\\'s younger sister was frozen like a statue. These two beings floated across the yard,toward the frozen blonde haired young lady. Her mother ran right at the two beings screaming no you can\\'t take my daughter. One of the beings raised their hand knocking the running mother over backwards, rendering her unconscious. The two beings came and took the daughter by the arms, floated back to the hovering craft, doors opened, in they went and the craft left slowly at first, then disappeared very quickly. The daughter was never returned. Since the summer of 1978, my friend\\'s sister has never been seen again. The mother had a complete nervous breakdown, as she told of her own abductions. Officially the daughter\\'s disappearance, has been categorized by the local police and FBI as an unsolved kidnapping. Everyone I have told this story to has never believed me.

       "       'August 8, 2006 Lancaster, PA at 1 pm  I saw a steel blue oval shaped object traveling rapidly in a straight line in front of the clouds We were on our lunch break.  A co-worker of mine was explaining how rainbows form inside the ice crystals of stratus clouds.  I looked up at the sky and my attention was immediately grabbed by an small object flying through the sky.  It was very small, but I could DEFINATELY identify it\\'s color and shape.  It was oval shaped...almost like the shape that a ball assumes if you put pressure on it.  It was not as flat as the stereotypical \\'flying saucer\\' shape...more round.  I immediately thought to myself...\"that looks like a freakin\\' UFO\"!!  I stared and stared as it flew rather quickly across the sky...in front of the clounds.  It\\'s color was a very dark, steel blue.  I tracked it across the sky with my finger.  My other coworkers were returning from their lunch breaks also.  I was pointing and screaming...\"Look! What is that? What is that?\"  My coworkers were yelling back at me, \"Where? Where?\"  I I was freaking out, jumping up and down, yelling \"Right there! Right there!\"  But no one saw the stupid thing.  I was in shock as it disappeared from sight behind the roof of our office.    I am still in shock that no one saw it.  I\\'ve been running around the office trying to talk with the people who were out there...and they look at me like I am nuts.  I am submitting this report because I want to know if someone else saw something, or if there was a weather balloon, or jet fighter flying over Lancaster County, Pennsylvania at 1 pm on August 8, 2006.  I know people think I\\'m imagining things.  I really want some type of affirmation.  I know what an airplane looks like.  I know what jet fighters look like.  THEY ARE NOT ROUND!!  Was it a weather balloon?  Can they travel that fast?  This thing was not floating.  It didn\\'t hover.  It didn\\'t start and stop.  It didn\\'t fly sideways.  It flew in a straight line.  It was fast.  IT WAS OVAL shaped!  It was DARK BLUE!  I am a college educated professional woman.  I don\\'t believe in extraterrestial abductions and all of that sci-fi stuff.  I would really like to explain this.  I know people think I was hallucinating.  Perhaps I was.  I hope that someone out there saw it also.  I hope that it has an explanation.  If not...then I need to do some serious thinking.',\n",
       "       'Two crafts and orb in Jakes Corner with possible abduction, 5 witnesses   In late August of 1987 I was moving out of Arizona with my young son and had stopped to spend the night at my grandparents house in Jakes Corners. A friend of mine came by to say goodbye. I\\'d been loading the car and was standing in the yard with my friend, son, and grandparents. I then saw a very white light that looked like it was driving around the ground across the street on a hill. This happened just at early sunset. I was looking straight at the hill when I saw the object come up around the side of it and into view. At first I thought it was a dune buggy, but it only had a single beam out the front. In utter disbelief, I watched as it drove around to the top of the hill and then continued into the air. It moved very slowly and without sound. It was an extremely bright light and slowly moved across the street towards where we were. At this point we were all watching it. It was like a floodlight. After watching it for some time, maybe 15-20 minutes, my friend and I decided to get in his car and drive down the street to see if we could get a better view from another angle. At this point it was nearly over the street. While driving down the road I first saw a very small red light fly up from the ground and then fly up to the object. It seemed there was activity at the object with other smaller lights moving around it. Then to our left on the side of the road was another object. There are no houses or other structures in this area and nothing had been at this location previously. The object was very close to the road. It had an extremely bright white light shining out of an opening. We could not see the objects shape but it was very big, like the size of a garage. There was what resembled a hatch and the white light was pouring out from it, but it was too bright to make out any details inside of it. We decided to drive up to it. As we neared it, perhaps 40-50ft away the car engine died. Simultaneously with the engine dying what appeared to be the hatch began to close shut. It finally cl! osed com pletely and we were getting scared. The engine kicked back in and we returned to the house. By now the object in the sky was over the house. My grandparents were watching it with binoculars. We were not able to tell the shape of the object. My grandmother called Luke AFB and they told her they hadn\\'t received any reports. At this point, and I realize this is strange but it\\'s true, everyone seemed to act like \"so what, theres a ufo over the house\" and we got sleepy. My grandparents and son went inside to bed. My friend and I decided to go to sleep - on the front lawn, as if that was perfectly natural. We just fell alseep out on the ground. At one point I woke up and couldn\\'t move and saw a blue light flooding the area but couldn\\'t see a source. I then recall what may be a very strange dream. (?) Small people approached us and said they were going to check our feet and that they would not approach my grandparents. They did some physical exams. My friend was completely unconscious but I was awake and speaking to them in some manner although I was not able to move. The people did not move their mouths when they spoke. At one point they told me a being was there, I understood it to be a type of scientist. The creature or thing was like nothing I can describe, it somewhat resembled a giant praying mantis. It was fish or bug-like and was abosultely the most horrible thing I\\'ve ever seen. I became terrified and was fighting them. It was my impression that this creature did not have any compassion for humans. It did not speak to me but had a very cold presence. The next thing I know, my friend and I woke up in the morning still laying on the front lawn. Everyone - my grandparents, son, and friend actted like nothing had happened. They were like \"oh yah, we saw a ufo\" as if that was perfectly natural. I was the only one that seemed to think something incredible had occurred. We spoke about the examination of the feet and we realized that my friend had webbed toes which I didn\\'t know, and I have double jointed toes! as does my son. Over the years my grandparents referred to this ufo event from time to time, and my son remembers the episode and says that one of the beings spoke to him. 2007 is the 20 yr anniversary of this event. I\\'ve often wondered about what happened that night, and although it sounds incredible what I\\'ve related is true. After the event I had an interest in science and have since earned a masters in astronomy. As long as I live I will NEVER forget the sight of that object driving up the side of the hill and going into the air! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

We were going to Max Patch Mountain, a large mountainous bald approx. 50 acres.   We arrived at around 8 pm laid out a blanket and looked for meteors as we often do at this site…. Weekly.  We were both sober and neither of us has ever reported a UFO experience.   We sat looking at the stars for around an hour the event time listed is approximate, and we saw a few shooting stars as normal.  I lit a cigarette and over the opposite ridge from where we were sitting a large glowing disk shaped object emerged.   The object slowly drifted in our direction and within seconds was directly over our head.  The bottom of the craft looked like a mass of glowing jelly.  I know this sounds weird but hey its what I saw.  A greenish color that turned a turquoise blue at it’s edges.   We were standing there looking in amazement when a flash of light broke my concentration.  I looked to my girlfriend and she was as bewildered as I felt.  The cigarette in my hand was burnt to the butt and had burned my fingers to a red color...and of course it hurt like I was burnt.   How long did I observe the craft?  Were we abducted? Why don’t I remember the time it took for a full cigarette to burn or remember it burning my hand?  This location is miles from civilization approximately 8 mi’s of dirt road travel from the interstate and is often regarded as one of the most beautiful places on the Appalachian Trail.   Any insight into what may have happened would be appreciated.  Has this occurred within a reasonable distance of this location before?

       "       'Aduction - Exam of Ears On the morning (7:45) of Friday, June 15, 2007, my daughter (age 6) said that she had a nightmare. I sat down next to her on the bed preparing to explain away some story of witches or dragons when she told me this. She said that she was in a room with a giant \"hornet,\" but it wasn’t really a hornet but more like a mixture of a cricket and hornet. \"Like a praying mantis thing but taller.\"  She also said that there were other creatures, \"shorter, like three and a half feet tall.\" They didn’t look like insects but they didn’t look like people to her either. She also described them as having \"very black eyes.\"  She also noticed that shorter creatures where wearing shoes/boots \"like the kind basketball players wear.\" She recalls lying down while they put some sort of tube or instrument in her ears; she also said that it was the reason for the \"bad taste in her mouth.\"  At this point she started to resist, she said that she fought off two of them, and then awoke in her bed. I tried to put aside my fear and concern and assured her that this was nothing more than a bad dream, but it sounds more like a typical abduction story.  Is there anything I can do combat this sort of invasion?',\n",
       "       '10/15/89 Bright fast moving light over valley west of Glennallen, Alaska Extreme bright light moving East to South West across a wide valley.  This was AFTER is was right behind my parked car.  I was driving back to Anchorage, it was late, and I parked in a rest area about 25 miles from Glennallen, Alaska.  No houses or buildings for several miles from the rest or pull off area. A large tractor trailer truck, that had not been there when I pulled into the rest area, was there after the bright light (which gave off a loud humming noise) shot off toward the South West.  I had gotton out of the car to try to figure out what was going on. I was very suprised to see the truck.  I didn\\'t hear it come into the rest area, and it was parked 20-30 feet from the front of my Audi sedan.  I ran to the driver\\'s door on the truck. The driver just looked at me and said something like you see things out here at night that no one would believe, or words to the effect.  I was pretty excitited at the time. This happened 18 years ago.  I had no idea who to tell it to or report it to until seeing something about the National UFO Reporting Center on TV last night on the History Channel.  Also, I was concerned about saying anything to anyone other than my wife as it could have effected my professional life. I did not see what looked like a craft.  The light was so bright and it moved so fast I was simply stunned.  The humming noise was very loud.  I can only descpribe is a \"electrical\" in nature.  No other way to describe the sound other than the volume. I believe there is more to this.  However, in an effort to keep from sounding like I\\'m crazy I will leave this report as is.  It was the strangest experience of my life.  I do not drink or do drugs.  Never have.  It would be possible for someone to think I was under the influance after giving the full details of the incident.  I don\\'t believe I was abducted.  However, the truck and driver and electrical problems (which cured themselves) with the car would tend to make it look like I was abducted or came close. To this day I have no idea what happened.

We watched the still floating object speculating that it might be a weather balloon. However, the size and the stillness of the object lead us to believe it was not a weather balloon. The object remained in the sky and did not move for over 45 minutes. It was unaffected by the breeze in the air.  It filled a good part of the western sky and did not make any noise. We joked about being abducted and went into the house to put our children to bed. The object was still in the sky when we went in.

In the center of this light was a multicolored tubular beam of light coming down to the ground. I stepped out my door to see it better and heard a car in the distance approching this area. As soon as the approching cars lights came over the hill, the big lights I had been watching instantly disappeared. I then watched the car drive down the road and realized how big the light I saw were compared to this cars lights. I told my husband about it and he said I may have seen an abduction.  There are no cows in this feild this time of year. The next morning I looked at the spot where I saw the light and noticed a power pole that could of been in line with the beam. Almost like it could of been accessing the electricity. I have seen many UFO's but always somehow knew they were aware of me.

       "       'Nevada desert UFO blazing near Area 51! My husband and I were returning to our home in Caliente, NV, from a business trip to Carson City, NV.  We were on Hwy. 375 Westbound approximately 3 miles beyond Nye/Lincoln Co. border, about 20 miles from Rachel.  My husband first spotted the UFO from the driver’s side window and told me to look.  It was glowing orange, resembling the color of rocket flame exhaust or jet engine under thrust propulsion.  It appeared to be cigar shaped, but from our vantage seemed to be a disk shaped object seen from the side.   It initially appeared to be about  ½ mi. away from us and from that distance probably 25 feet thick, (top to bottom) and 250-300 feet in diameter. These are very rough guesses from night time viewing.  It was a clear and bright night, the moon full.  There appeared a series of 6-8 ‘boxes’ on what we believe to be the side of the craft.  The boxes lit up sequentially from right to left, remaining aglow for 10-15 seconds before reversing the process and slowly extinguishing.  It then reappeared some distance to the right (E) and farther away.  At the end of each sequence, only the forward most orange light remained visible.  We maintained visual contact until it crested the range of mountains due NE of Rachel and SW of Caliente.  The next visual contact was at mile marker 73 on US Hwy. 93N, 20 miles outside of Caliente.  We were E bound coming out of an area known as Delamar Flats and entering the local mountain range known as the Caliente Summit (Oak Springs Summit).  We saw one flash appearing much further in the distance, due E of our location and repeated its sequence twice.  At the end of the second sequence the front glowing light remained constant, visible until it became so distant in the horizon it disappeared.   It maintained its single glowing orange light and looked almost like an orange star in the night sky.  The time summary of the entire viewing event from start to finish was about a half hour.  I was unable to photograph object because of my autofocus camera not cooperating.  We do not believe to have had any loss of time or do not suspect abduction.  We wonder if anyone else has seen anything similar to this?',\n",
       "       '1959 childhood encounter with a spherical, faceted object, that had landed in my back yard in Miami. It was some time in 1959.  I can\\'t verify the date.  I was 5 and hadn\\'t started school yet.  My family lived in Miami (our address was considered to be Opa Locka) but I would attend school the next year in Carol City.  We lived a short distance from the Opa Locka airport (then, a military airport).  Our home was not near anything but rock pits and cow pastures.  We lived on 1/2 acre lot.  Some time, in the middle of the night, I woke up.  I saw the cat was inside and followed her through the house.  She wanted to go outside, so I opened the door and I followed her outside.  I walked into our backyard and saw at the back corner of our yard a large dark sphere.  Curious, I went closer to see what it was.  The object sitting in our yard was about 40\\' in diameter and faceted - like a disco ball.  The facets were small and bevelled, but clear - like glass.  There was a lot of moonlight, so I could see the color of the glass appeared to be bronze.  There was no light emanating from it, but it looked like whatever was in it could have seen out the glass.  I became afraid thinking that a door might open (and maybe it did - because I have a vague memory of seeing a black ramp extend from the lower fourth of it) and ran back inside the house and locked the door.  (Back then we NEVER locked a door.)  The next morning, my mother asked me what I was doing up.  (I think my return to the house and slamming the door woke her up.)  I told her I was letting the cat out of the house.  She thought I was sleepwalking, she said the cat wasn\\'t left in the prior night.  I can\\'t remember if I told her what I saw in the back yard.  If I did, that too was probably written off as \"sleepwalking.\"  I may talk in my sleep, but I have not had any other experience with sleepwalking.  After this incident, I began having a recurring nightmare about being abducted by people who looked like my parents, but weren\\'t.  I would be in the back seat of the car riding along with my parents, when I would realize they were different, not my parents.  I would jump out of the moving car and run back to my grandparents\\' home.  When I would get there, my parents would be there.  But, I could tell they weren\\'t my parents either.  This recurring nightmare went on for about two years before subsiding.  I am 53, female, have a slightly above-average IQ, and that\\'s it.  I have often wondered if there\\'s a relationship between the nightmare and the sighting. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))',\n",

I was told not to use Hines Drive because it is deserted and if I had car problems I would be in trouble.  Hines Drive was the shortest way.   I took a chance and went down Hines Drive.  It was very dark and deserted.  Although, I had choosen the route, I became to regret it.  All of a sudden I saw a large shiney object on the right side of the road.  Round shaped with bright blinking lights.  I would have never pulled over, but, there was one other car with a women already stopped, in front of me.  She was out of her car.  I pulled off the road behind her and got out of the car. I said to her, \"Do you see what I see\" and she said \"yes\" or \"I think so\".  It was like seeing something and not believing what you are seeing.  I wish I had taken her number or she had taken mine.  I said it must be some kind of publicity stunt for an upcoming movie or a radio station promotion or something like that.  We stood there and stared in fascination and amazement shaking our heads.  We both got back into our cars and I preceeded to go to the shower.  Although, I had left early, took the shortest route, I arrived at the shower very late.

       "       'Witnessed numerous UFO\\'s along I-5 from Stockton south to Tehachipi on busy holiday weekend. This event took place in 1973. I was 21 years old and traveled from San Diego County to Portland Ore with my brother and his wife on 4th of July weekend.   My brother was in army aviation at the time and I was a student pilot.  Another brother was an air controller for the SAC, a close cousin an army pilot and his brother an Air Force kicker.  We grew up adjacent to air bases: Kirkland, Biggs, Mira Mar and Camp Pendleton. We are very familiar with aircraft and their abilities.  On the return trip from Portland we were at the cloverleaf of I-5 and I-580 in the Stockton California area at dusk. (perhaps 8PM). The freeways were very busy. My brother and I saw a craft coming from our 10 o\\'clock position very low. Our first assumption was that it was a crop duster as they are common in that vicinity and they prefer to work right up to sunset. The craft had three lights, red, green and amber, not unlike any aircraft except that they were in the wrong positions and the anti-collision lamp did not blink.  The craft came in right over our windshield at about 60 -100 ft AGL!  We looked directly up at it but only saw a blur. It appeared to be transparent. It past over us to our 2 o\\'clock position and only about 300 ft lateral and 100 ft altitude. I got a good look at it. It was tubular with a simple frame for a fuselage. The craft was transparent as if made from see through covering. It had short stubs protruding from its sides that were not sufficient to be wings or airfoils. It had no engines.  It immediately, without turning, returned in our direction while descending.  An impossible maneuver for any aircraft that I know of. It\\'s speed was slow, perhaps 45mph. The stubs turned out to have bright lamps attached and they were activated nearly blinding us. The craft flew down to the deck illuminating the field of wheat (or rice) and pushing it aside as it moved a few feet above it. I again got a close look and the craft was not a duster or helicopter. I have never known dusters to use lights as dusting is too dangerous at night.  We looked at other motorists at they seemed not to notice. We followed the progress of the crafts as it continued to crisscrossed I-5 in a similar fashion as we moved south at about 80 mph. Complete darkness fell swiftly. We then saw many craft with two lights performing the same maneuvers amongst the fields. They were acting as if they were looking for something on the ground by \"strafing\" it with their lights which were too close together to be mistaken as autos in the distance. We also noticed that at times they would stop and hover over the California Aqueduct and shine their beams downward. We stopped several times to witness the events. Though many times the hovering objects were close they made no sound.  Again other motorists seemed to notice nothing. There were usually three in sight at all times. We tried to rationalize that it was helicopters, agricultural machinery or autos in the distance. However, in the following years i made that same trip many times at night and never saw anything like it again. Our only rational thought was that it was police looking for someone. We listened to the radio in ernest hoping for a news announcement. Of course there was none. The object(s) began following us at fence top level along the opposite side of the freeway, about 100 yards behind. We tested them several times by speeding up to 140 mph and then slowing to about 20mph. The craft(s) kept pace with us! When they seemed to be bored with this game they would fly off laterally at high speed but still stay within sight. Often they would be replaced by another in their former position.  After the initial first sighting near Stockton, my sister-in-law fell asleep in the back seat. We attempted several times over the next few hours to awake her to witness the show but were unable to. She was clearly alive but slapping and shaking could not wake her.  We were totally confused and decided to stop in at a truck stop a few miles off the freeway near the bottom of the Grapevine. We had witnessed this phenomenon for about three hours at this point. We made casual inquiries in the restaurant of the staff and truckers but no one saw anything. My sister-in-law remained unconscious. We continued on our trip south and had no more sightings.  Upon awaking the next day my brother and I went over what had transpired. We discovered that we were missing somewhere between 90 and 180 minutes of time. We checked our gas receipts which were dated and time stamped and new our speed averaged 80 mph except for the few times we stopped which we accounted for. We had no sensation that we were abducted then or since and suffered no ill effects.  Many years later I read a book by a UFO investigator that stated that 1973 was a big \"flap\" year in California and the Central Valley in general.',\n",
       "       'Small craft docked on the side of a much larger craft.  Within 200 feet of both. It’s been on my mind lately, in 1974 I was near the Palisades Power Plant in Covert Michigan while it was being built if I remember right. Anyway I was on apart of US 31 which had been cut off because of the building of the power plant, watching the sky as I usually did back then. I was sitting on the side of the road facing south. As I watched to the east, south and west I saw a large saucer shaped craft probably 80 to 95 feet in diameter rise up out of the swampy area to my left and a bit behind me. What has always bothered me is  that there was a smaller saucer shaped craft docked on the side of the large one. Both craft were a gray metallic color but had no lights of any kind. There was absolutely no sound, I sat watching it rise up to about tree top height and then it stopped  and hovered. I was about 200 feet away from the crafts, it just hovered there for about a minute as I studied it. Well it was not moving so I decided I  would. I turned my Datsun pick up around moving back to the North, drove under the crafts. I know they were real because I saw them in my mirror and saw the crafts move across the road to the west as I drove away. Like I said the one docked on the side really bothers me, I have never heard of a UFO with one docked on the side of it. Have You? I was not abducted I know that for sure, I went immediately to a near by friends house. Had him grab his camera and go with me up into the hills between US 31 and Lake Michigan. As we neared the area just north of the power plant where a boy scout camp was located we saw the out line of the craft through the tree canopy above. We could not get any kind of a picture because of the tree cover. It continued westerly out over Lake Michigan. By the time we reached the bluffs above the lake the craft was out of sight. Also my pick up started to run very rough, missing and spitting . I returned my friend back to his home and I continued back to my home, barely making it. The next morning my truck refused to start, it would turn ! over but not start. I had just tuned it up days earlier and found the new points and spark plugs burned away as if they had many thousands of miles on them.

       "       'Life altering UFO abduction experiences  500 Lights On Object0: Yes I’m a 47 year old male who’s had a multitude of UFO experiences throughout many years which begins as follows:  1974,  one spring morning I was a 13 year old kid living on a farm with my parents on Roblar Rd. Petaluma California. My older brother and I were headed for the school bus just up the road while on our walk we spotted two small red brightly glowing spheres around the size of small basket balls. The red balls came out of some bushes across the road then danced around each other as they hovered in front of my brother and my faces. Both of us were stunned and starred as these hovering balls of light moved around us then proceeded up the middle of the road as they sped off. When the reached the top of the hill they headed straight up then disappeared.  My brother and I just looked at each other without saying a word. My brother shrugged his shoulders and shook it off as if he’d just seen something that didn’t exist. The other kids showed up at the bus stop and I asked if any of them saw the lights when one of the kids said, “They were car lights you saw you moron.” I dismissed the incident and really didn’t think any more about it till later in life.  One summer night in 1977 my older brother, two girls and myself were in the Sonoma Mountains in Sonoma County California drinking a few beers like a lot of teens did at the time when my first incident occurred.  It was late night, around midnight, my brother and I were standing outside the vehicle while the two girls were inside when my brother pointed to some bushes around a football field away and said, “What the f---- is that?” I looked to where he was pointing and I saw a rather large glowing orange dome just on the other side of the trees. Not knowing what it was I replied, “I don’t know.” I became entranced with the object as it began growing in size getting bigger and bigger. My brother ordered me back in the car and said, “Let’s get out of here.”  I said, “No, wait, let’s check it out.” He once again ordered, “Get the f---- in the car little brother or I’m leaving you here.” I jumped in, we took off down the mountains and nothing more was said about it until a few days later when my brother asked, “Do you know what that was we saw in the mountains?” I replied, “I don’t have a clue.” My brother continued and said, “Little brother, that was God!”  Thinking he was kind of nuts for saying it I dismissed the conversation. This concluded this incident.  Later on that same year, sometime in the winter evening, I was once again parked close to the same spot in the mountains with a different friend this time. It was around 10:00 pm. And we were talking about things we wondered about. I was saying I wonder why this and this happens when my friend said, “What I wonder is what the hell is that?” He was pointing to an orange harvest moon across town just above the other mountain range. I laughed and replied, “It’s the moon you idiot.” My friend looked dead serious to me then pointed up into the sky then said, “Oh yeah, then what’s that.” He was now pointing at what appeared to be another moon. Being rather shocked I replied, “I don’t know.”  We watched as another harvest moon appeared next to the first one in the mountains, soon a third one appeared.  “We’ve got to check these things out,“ Said my friend as he started the car and sped across town to the other set of mountains. We weren’t sure exactly where they were so we guessed and headed out Two Rock Road in Petaluma California. When we reached the coast guard base we drove up to the guard tower and asked if they saw three glowing harvest moons in the mountains. Needless to say they treated us as if we were nuts and sent us on our way. That night we never did find the objects or see them anywhere else.  1984, Seven years later, I was around 24  years old working in Healdsburg California. I had to commute from Petaluma California to Healdsburg which was around a 45 minute drive everyday which I had to be at work by 6:00 AM. Needless to say I had to get up pretty early in the morning to make it there. I’ve always been a very anal person always making it to work at least 20 minutes early so I could have enough time to relax, drink some coffee and back in those days, smoke some cigarettes. This incident is a weird one as I didn’t remember most of what I’m writing about until much later in life. Anyway, I left to work one day at the same time that I always left then headed up Highway 101 north to Healdsburg. I remember leaving the town of Santa Rosa Heading North and driving through what used to be the usual desolate area of Windsor. As I was driving suddenly I started feeling very tired when I looked in my rear view mirror and noticed two very bright lights, speeding up on me. I thought to myself who’s this idiot going this fast? As the lights approached the rear of my vehicle my car slowed down to a stop. I remember trying to give it gas but it wouldn’t move. Suddenly the car went completely dead and all I could see were very bright lights behind me. I remember wondering what was going on. The lights moved from the rear of my vehicle rising above my car, when suddenly I hear a loud bumping noise much like a tow truck would make as it lifts up a car. I felt my car being lifted off the ground. I tried opening the doors but they were locked. I remember jumping into the back seat and trying the rear door but it was locked. I remember white light all around me and being totally petrified. The next thing I remember was sitting in the driver seat with my engine running but parked off on the side of the road. I shook my head in disbelief and wondered what happened if anything.  I stepped on the gas an my car took off up highway 101 as I headed to Healdsburg. I seriously didn’t know what happened and wondered if an! ything d id happen at all. I arrived to work, went in and poured a cup of coffee like I usually did. I lit up a smoke when and noticed one of my co-workers working. I asked, “Hey D--, why are you here so early?” D-- looked at me, laughed and replied, “Why are you so late?” I asked, “Late, what do you mean? I’m not late.” He laughed again and said, “You idiot, you’re 20 minutes late.” Being a little bewildered I put out my smoke then headed to the time clock where I realized he was right, I wasn’t only 20 minutes late but, rather 40 as I usually arrived 20 minutes early every day. When I got home both my wife and I checked our clocks and none of them were off. There were 40 minutes missing from my day.  1987 Three years later I was around 27 years old living in a cottage on a hill in rural Petaluma California. It was sometime in spring around 2:00 am. I woke to the sound of a humming noise and looked at the walls above my bed noticing bright lights going around them. I tried to wake up my wife but couldn’t so I hopped out of bed. I went to my daughters room next to ours and checked in on her and she was sound asleep also. I walked in the living room which had windows overlooking the hillside. I looked out the window past the grove of trees and saw bright lights. There was nothing on the hill and the lights made no sense at all being there. The lights resembled the brightness of lights used by freeway crews while working on the roads at night.  I turned and noticed the lights bouncing off the wall mirrors so wanting to get a better look a headed out the front door, closing it behind then out off the porch into the yard. In my underwear I exited the gate which opened in to the field then looked up on the hill. About 200’ in front of me was a large glowing sphere hovering a few feet off the ground. The sphere resembled a small harvest moon and I remembered wondering if I made a mistake going out to investigate. I looked back at the house and seeing the front door closed I wanted to go back in. I couldn’t move as I seemed to be paralyzed. Being very frightened I looked back at the sphere when suddenly three images appeared standing in the field. The images were men which looked just like us except very tall. They were somewhere around 8’ tall, well built and had bald heads. They were dressed in black jumpsuits and wore side arms. The next thing I remember was waking up in my bed around 8:00 am on a Saturday Morning. I remember opening my eyes wondering if I dreamed the who thing. It almost seemed like hours were missing from my night and I had a small hole or mark right in the center of my forehead which wasn’t there before.  Years later the entire incident started coming back to me and I began remembering  what happened. It was around 2000 when it became very vivid. There were not only the three beings looking like us but also others resembling the typical aliens with big eyes and grey skin. The beings looking like us seemed to be in charge and the other’s worked with them. The mark in my forehead, which is still there today was made by a long needle type instrument which was inserted into my skull. This instrument was used for something I’m not sure of. They communicated with me telepathically and seemed to download and upload information into and out of me. In summary, the visit was a religious experience in which they told me God and Jesus are real and do exist. I wasn’t a religious man before these incidents but afterwards they changed my life. What we communicated about back and forth was very in-depth and there’s not enough paper or time to cove the topics but, I’ll reiterate in saying they convinced me Jesus is still alive and went on to say that they are us and we are them. We come from them as they are our past.',\n",
       "       \"A black ball passes over us in perth, Aus, wa Around 8.00am, me and my friend arrived at the beach. We decide the spot we picked wasnt breaking that well, so we moved on to where it was thought to be better. We moved allong the sand dune as we watched the clouds roll by. Just as we watched, we saw a black ball aroung 1 km away from us. As it flew, it curved and flew against the wind.  It gradually came closer and as it did, didnt didnt appear to be growing in size. When it was directly aboves up approximatly 50m high, i went to grab my mobile to take a picture. As soon as i took my phone out of my pocket, the black ball slowed dramatically, i put my fone back into my pocket as the thought of abduction passed my mind. when the phone slipped back into my pocket, the ball sped back up and flew out alond the horizon towards the city.  The object was black and in a perfect ball sha. It appeared to be tennis ball sized from where we saw but actual size was probably a bowling ball, to a gymball's size. it fully resisted the wind and showed no signs of drag. it made absolutely no noise and didnt appear to have any windows or abstract objects, it was just a ball.  after this event occured, a severe thunder and hail storm cam in for about 1 hour, then the storm ceased into a beutiful warm calm day. because we were walking across the dune as a shortcut, no one else appeared to have seen it.\",\n",
       "       'Town and Country Shopping Center, dic shaped craft at about 20feet above the ground...around 4:30PM on a Sunday. For two weeks prior to the sighting, I had experienced telepathic communication with these beings.  I was waiting for the time of their arrival.  I spoke to no one of this at the time, and have only shared my experience witha few extremely close friends since the encounter.  I knew I would be called to the site telepathicly when they would arrive in my area.  It wsa Sunday afternoon around 4PM, when I felt drawn to Stevens Creek Blvd.  I  entered Town and Country Shopping Center\\'s parking lot a \"back way\" and when I pulled in, there was a group of people standing under the craft, which hovered about 20 feet in the air--- just above the rooftop.  It was close to a Tobacco store.  The man who worked in the store was one of hte witnesses.  I walked closer to the group, and had made the decision NOT to go with the beings prior to this physical encounter.  After standing with the  group[ for a ew more minutes---looking up to the bottom of the  craft, the craft raised upward without movement of air, or sound --no heat was felt---nothing.  It increased speed rapidly, and then dissapeared in an instant.  We all looked at each other, and dispersed in silence.  The experience was profound, and even more so because we had witnessed it together.  I have been looking in various places to see if any of the other witnesses have reported it, but I have not seen evidence of the sighting.  It affected me so  intensly, Ihad to report it--even though  it occurred all these years ago.  No one was abducted to my knowledge.  My comunication with them was indicative of a volulnteer scenario, and I was not willing to participate, but have the connection with them telepathicly.  I had a spiritually uplifitng sense, and was not frightened by the beings in the craft.  I never made visual contact. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.

       "       'Bright  light over Sun Set Park, viewed from Park Slope on Fifth Avenue, Brooklyn   I would walk my dog around 11pm every night. This night I noticed a very bright streetlight in the distance. I thought to my self that the light was going to burn out in moment because it was too bright. But instead it started to rise straight up in the air. At a distance of several hundred feet in the air, the oval object turned from bright white to bluish / green color and then despaired in front of my eyes. Just before it despaired I noticed some detailed lines around the object.  Feeling that I saw something exstordinary, I went home and called Kenny Airport and asked them if they had anything unusual on the radar screens. They told me that they could not give that information out. So I told them I wanted to report a UFO.  They did give me a phone number in Washington, DC to call. The next day I called that number and a Commando answered the phone and told me there usually is no activity in the North East reported, and that most of the activity is in the South West. He made me feel like no one really cares, and my report will not make a difference. He took my number and told me he would check in to it. Well the Commando did call me back and told me that there where no reports made.  Years later, finding out about peoples abductions, I came to mind that the object that I witnessed the night was extremely low to the roof tops, which could of meant that I witnessed an abduction. Wanting closure for myself and maybe someone else who might need to hear my report, I decided to finally make my report.  I heard about your reporting center on a documentary \"UFOs Seeing is Believing.\" ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))',\n",
       "       'My family were visiting disney world Christmas of 1987.  Because the family was from Winnipeg Manitoba Canada, we were staying in Tampa Bay Florida for half the duration of our trip (2 weeks)to Florida.  The other week was to be spent at bush gardens at a different hotel.  The hotel we were staying at was called the The Sonyesta.  On or around the night of 19 Dec 1987 we decided to visit a restaurant called King Henry\\'s Feast in Miami.  We left the hotel in Tampa at around 16:00 on the 19th and drove to Miami.  The King Henry\\'s Feast was a Medieval style dinner and show and the whole affair lasted many hours so by the time we left Miami to go back to our hotel in Tampa bay it was quite late, around 0:00. At around 1:00 am we were on a deserted stretch of highway near - as far as I can remember- swampy country with scattered palm trees.  Because it was somewhat dark I can only remember seeing flat ground with telltale plantlife that indicated swamp such as sparsh high grass, rushes and bumpy, in some places, reflective ground indicating stagnant water in addition to the dark outlines of palm trees.  I remember that the moon was full when we left Miami but at 1:00 on the highway it became foggy. My memory becomes hazy at this point, but I recall other cars stopped by the road and people looking at something in the sky.  I recall the other passengers in the car gasp and say \"oh look!\".  I recall seeing three other people besides the passengers in our car.  The other peoples cars seemed to have headlights on. The passengers of our car consisted of 4 people.  Firstly myself age 7.  I was at that age an avid camper with my parents and that is how I knew what swamp looked like.  I am now 28 and a Captain in the PPCLI, a Canadian Infantry unit and I have seen action in Afghanistan.  My father is a doctor who practiced at the St James Clinic and Misecordia hospital in Winnipeg, Manitoba Canada.  My Mother was or was studying at the time, to take her bar exam.  She has been called to the bar in Winnipeg and British Columbia Canada.  She no longer practices law but is a stay at home Mom for my younger siblings who were not yet born at the time.  The final passenger was my Dad\\'s mother and my grandma who is now deceased but at the time worked at a clothing store for senior citizens in Winnipeg. My Father and Mother were in the front 2 seats of the car and my Grandmother and me in the back.  As we approached what I remember to be one or two cars pulled over at the side of the road with people beside them I perceived 6 light blue glowing lights rotating in the sky.  Each was the size of a quarter in my memory, but only because they were some distance away.  I seem to recall we got out of the car at this point to look at the lights but I have another memory of staying in the car the whole time.  The lights did nothing but rotate, in my memory at an angle and down towards our car.  The whole scene-like a picture- was us, bottom right ground, road bottom middle, other people and cars bottom left.  Mid right was shadow of palm trees, mid center was fog but flat bumpy ground, mid right was fog, top right fog, top center fog with some traces of moonlight seeping through and top right were the six blue lights rotating at an angle facing us. I do not recall how long we lingered watching the lights but at some point during this time I recall glancing out of curiosity at the other people near our car and to our left to see if they were as amazed as us.  I recall a man with shaved head and glasses in a white shirt looking calmly back at me with an amused expression.  I have conlicting memories of this man; one memory that he was in another car and I saw him through a window and another memory that he was outside the cars to my left at about 9 feet away. At this point I draw a blank and do not recall if the lights disappeared or we just got bored and decided to leave.  We got back to Tampa Bay and had no other encounters since.  After returning to Canada at the end of the vacation we did not discuss at all afterwards memories of the vacation.  Anytime I brought up the issue of the lights my mother scolded me, dismissed the event or made fun of me so I soon let the matter drop. Upon remembering this event last year in September 2007, I questioned my father and mother at a restaurant and it took them by surprise.  I said simpley \"do you remember the 6 blue rotating lights in Florida?\"  My father remarked off hand (and without any prompting from me) that there were lots of people watchig the event.  My mother then remarked that she had no memory of other people there.  We were all 3 of us discussing the event further in the car and my mother became very agitated and angry while my father seemed very curious and trying to remember more, or so it seemed to me.  My Mother did give me a detail I had not remembered-my Grandmother had decided to purchase communion which was a book about alien abduction.  My Mother told me all this nonsense about UFOs was due to my Grandmother scaring me.  I do not recall ever discussing the event with my Grandmother at all. Please let me know if anyone has had a similar experience. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))',\n",
       "       'Large black triangle, lights on the corners. Moving 3 or 4 mph right above the treetops. Faint humming noise. Not sure of date and time, Happened over 10 years ago. In my friends back yard. Heard a faint humming noise. Stars and moon got blacked out. Looked up and saw a large black triangle, lights on the corners. Moving right above the treetops directly over us moving about 3 or 4 mph. This thing was wider than his house, Im guessing that it was about 150 foot wide.

       "       'Low flying object with light shining down on road , apparently a helicopter which made no noticeable noise. I was driving across Kansas on my way to California. It was late at night and i had just left a truck stop where i had a cup of coffee. About 100 yards off the road to my left there was what appeared to be an accident where someone had rolled over out in the field. There was what appeared to be emergency vehicles there with what looked like a floodlight on the vehicle.  I didn\\'t stop because there was no need to with what seemed to be emergency vehicles attending. Actually the whole scene seemed surreal. As i continued down the two lane highway, I remember listening to Art Bell on coast to coast radio and there was a show on that was sort of a take off on that 1948 radio show with Orson Welles and \"War of the Worlds\". I remember that on the show, there were alien spacecraft landing around the United States. I remember being momentarily sort of alarmed as i was listening to the broadcast. A couple of minutes later, I noticed a light ahead of me shining down on the road and coming towards me.  I assumed that the light was from a medivac helicopter going to the rollover accident to evacuate injured people. As the light shining down on the road approached and flew over my vehicle I noticed that there was no noise coming from the object which was at a very low altitude (i\\'d guess no more than 100 ft or so).  I remember how strange it was that a helicopter could be flying that low and make no noticeable noise.  I remember looking in my rear view mirror and saying to myself, what the \"F\" was that thing. Basically,  I forgot about the whole incident until a couple of years ago when I was talking to my son about UFO\\'s while we were having dinner at an Applebee\\'s Restaurant.  Suddenly I just remembered the incident.... as if it was a dream though, and not something that actually took place. He talked to a friend of his who said that I probably had been abducted by a ufo and that they planted the false memories of the accident and the coast to coast show to mask the incident to me. Personally, i don\\'t really know.  The whole thing still seems pretty surreal as if it happened but it didn\\'t happen.

       "       \"orb in back garden took off extended into a tail of light then vanished  500 Lights On Object0: Yes I was awoken in the middle of the night and was urged to go outside and look up at the sky to the north. I saw a large stationary craft and in a moment or so smaller craft emerged single file almost, first to the west then from the opposite side of the craft to the east but this was going on simultaneously. About a dozen in each direction emerged, (without counting)  I was then urged to look to my left and up to the tree under which I saw a ball of white light smaller, but not much, than a basketball. It appeared to have an intelligent presence and was observing me from a distance of only about 15 feet. Seconds later, as though driven away by my attitude it took off in a westerly direction climbing at an angle of about 60 degrees. As it did so it elongated into a tail of light then disappeared, not in the distance but simply a short distance away - it just vanished. Time travelling came to mind. The weidest thing was that throughout as is often the case it appeared as a normal circumstance and nothing to worry about and this feeling lasted for three weeks after which time it literally wore off and I freeked out. I also want to record several other sightings. Several times around 2000 I witnessed the searchlight which seemed to go on forever but unlike some other sightings I believe I was given an explanation on one of these occasions and far more detailed and absolutely fascinating observations. The searchlight emanated from a stationary craft, quite close, in the sky and went to and fro ad nauseum , not on the ground but on thin air! in the sky around an axis point roughly level with the originating craft on the horizontal plane, in an arc of around 130 to 150 degrees of a circle.to and fro, to and fro ad nauseum. the 'spotlight' a kind of end circle with the conical beam just like you see normally but only a short distance from the originating craft . Hard to tell air distances but around 100 feet at a guess. But on one occasion it got very interesting and I was told to watch this... a narrow beam of light shot out from the originating craft independent of the searchlight bisecting the searchlight arc and stopping at its extreme perimeter. this then disappeared and a blue rectangle of light appeared vertically over the area of the arc search in a flash and remained for a moment or two then that too disappeared. It seemed to my mind and I don't know how , except to say intuitively that the narrow beam was like a fishing line and that the rectangle of light was the hook which retreived the INFORMATION, the whole point of the exercise, that the searchlight had been gathering about the people below it asleep in their homes and or the physical environment and that when these two lights disappeared the information was retreived safely on board the space craft. I found the whole thing fascinating and still do. Now why did they want to show me these things unless they were friendly craft - right? If you appreciated hearing about this please let me know I may or may not be allowed to detail a myriad of other things including scoop marks missing time seeing my abductors, responding to implanted thoughts, always benign as if they were my own,a cigar shaped vehicle having trouble leaving this time dimension - I can prove this using Einsteins exact same descriptions for the same. My own time travel back to the building of the pyramids of giza,and information about it also corroborated by someone else, I don't know how he knew, and other fascinating things which would take lengthy pages to adequately detail but they point to meaning and communication, the missing ingredient in most reports.

       "       'Sightings of multiple craft disappearing and reappearing in sky, possible abduction. It was a rather clear day.  Very little cloud cover. I witnessed at least one craft silver/grey in color, very reflective.  I cannot give an estimate of the altitude of the craft in question.  It flew across the sky from E to S.  At a point around SE it disappeared from the sky.  It had not changed direction or speed.  I did not take my eyes off the object.  Upon scanning the sky, I discovered the object in question back at the original place in the sky at compass E.  Around this time of that year, I witnessed several craft having the same characteristics both in behavior and appearance.  The most notable sighting of these craft occurred around this time as well.  I saw one of these craft while in the backyard of my house.  The cigar-shaped craft crossed the sky, then stopped in mid-air.  A blue light came off of it, shining brightly even in mid-afternoon.  I don\\'t recall exactly what happened that day, other than two odd things that I cannot account for.  One: I seem to have blacked out, but I came out of it standing upright in a different part of the yard than where I was when I saw the light.  Two: My clothes seemed in dissarray, my shirt was on inside-out and my pants\\' zipper was down.  I have since then had a dream about that day.  I do not consider the dream to be 100% reliable.  It may be the actual events of that day or merely my imagination.  However, the dream started out exactly like my real memories of that day.  In my dream I see the craft come down and hover over my house.  The next scene is me sitting naked in a white room with sophisticated equipment on my right and 2-3 \"greys\" in front of me.  There is a being to my immediate right holding an instrument in his hands and he moves behind me and I feel a pain behind my right ear.  Since that day, I have a noticeable lump behind my ear.  I have not had it taken out or seriously evaluated by a medical professional.  I have other accounts of odd sightings but will file them according to time/date.

The road was dark and there was no one or a car around.  I walked across the road and went to open the drivers side door and get in.  Simple enough.  Not thinking of anything but getting home.  But rather then getting in the truck before I even opened the door the last think I remember were my feet lifting and my balance going backward like I was slipping but my feet we already off the ground.  Then everything in my mind went black.  The first part is not that scary but it is the next part that I have trouble sharing.  I do not remember an abduction or aliens of a ship nothing.  I woke up about a mile or so north of the PCH in the low hills of the Santa Monica Mountains.   I need to talk to you I can't write the rest of this down it is very upseting.  How do I get a hold of you please let me know ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))\",\n",
       "       'Strange Red Craft/ UFO Nightmares This was a really disturbing experience for us.(but also i would like to keep my self annonymous, thank you for understanding)  One night, i forgot the exact day. i do remember the date and year. It was july 1st, 2003. my brother was over his friend\\'s house. he said he noticed a \"red oval object\" followed him ever since he noticed it floating over the dark sky. when he arrived home, he was filled with excitement, he yelled \"UFO, i saw a red ufo in the sky\" Then he told us to go outside to see it. We were in our backyard.  There it was, the object looked like a \"Red fire ball\" floating in the cloudless dark sky. it didn\\'t made any sounds. thus it floated in a circular rotation. it did this for about 10 minutes. we walked toward a bit. the object seemed to move towards us, that\\'s when we paniked. we went back inside the house. we were just watching it from our windows. The object didn\\'t look like a \"red fire ball\" anymore. it looks rather more like a space ship. the object now looked like a flat pancake, but it looked as two flat bowls were on top on one another.it had many different lights. and different colors. the top lights were yellow, the spinned in a revolutionary way(circular motions)  the bottom lights were blinding yellow and white. the didn\\'t blink or anything, they just were blinding all the time. Me, my brother and sister were amazed as we watched the craft hover a bit closer to our house. we NEVER saw anything like this. it couldn\\'t be a plane or helicopter; planes do not hover around in circular motions for quite an amount of time, and helicopters tend to make sound.  anyway, the object was there; a flat pancake looking craft with a bunch of lights. the color of the craft was also metallic. As the craft got closer, we began to panic even more.  Me,my sister, and brother were nervous because it was floating closer and closer above our house. so we rushed and closed the windows fast, i was the one who closed the last window and i saw IT very very close above the house. it had so many lights from the bottom area of the craft. i stood still, then after i closed the last window, a Very LOUD humming sound was heard, the whole house shook for about 5 seconds, we froze , not moving, just looking at eachother\\'s eyes. the whole house vibrating.. and a loud humming sound was heard, even our dog was still when this happened. objects also fell from the counter tops. After those 5 seconds, i looked outside the window and the UFO was gone. We never had this odd experience before. Me, my sister and brother questioned eachother with confusion. we asked eachother \"what the hell just happened? did you hear and feel that?\" i asked both of them \"did you hear that humming sound! you guys didn\\'t move\"  we couldn\\'t sleep that night, we kept all the lights on in case that weird Object returned, we were freaked out. we were just thinking of it. but this affected me more than it did to them..  After a few days after that Ufo incident, i began having weird dreams. i had these \"episode-like dreams\"  everytime i would go to bed after this incident happened, i would be afraid of sleeping with the lights off, or even having the window of the bathroom open.  Anyway, 3 nights after i saw the Ufo, i had this weird dream:  i layed in bed, after i fell asleep, i was blinded with a realy bright white light. i was laying on the surface. i woke up(in my dream) then i walked for white a long time, i felt fatigue and tired. the light was also foggy. then i noticed something pulled me into corridor.  Ok, after that happened, i woke up from my sleep. then i thought \"what the hell was that all about\"?  the next time,  i had another dream, but the weird thing about this was that, it continued. Ok this is what happened after i fell asleep the next night:  i was pulled into a corridor, i just felt something grabbing my arm, but couldn\\'t see who it was. The corridor was rather foggy, the temperature felt warm, too. after that, something pushed me to the floor. the floor was warm and moist(something liked a jungle floor) i looked around the area, the area was steamy, foggy.. it had a bunch of wiring around. also it had many many lights and different corridors or tunnels. the area i was in was rather circular and large.  ( i assumed i was in some type of room) after this happened i woke up.  Ok, this was getting a bit disturbing, i told my mom about this.. but then again, most people dislike to believe in these things. so i didn\\'t told anyone else because they wouldn\\'t listen.. the next night, i didn\\'t wanted to fall asleep, but i did.. this was the most frightful nightmare i ever had..the dream was the continuation of my dream i said above.. it resulted this:  i opened my eyes, in the same room, but i was laying on top of a surface. i couldn\\'t move, my legs, arms were weakened. all i saw was a foggy place.. the top ceiling was wiring and lights. this was the same big circular room. All of the sudden, i felt a hand touching my arm. i began noticing sounds around me. then i saw these creatures, About 4 of them.. They were tall, thin, they had slanted blueish eyes(asian looking). they were purplish transparent, No hair or facial features, just a slit for a mouth and two small dots that made out their nose. but since it was foggy, i couldn\\'t make them up more what they looked like. Ok, this is going to be more bizarre.. the creatures were communicating by making \"gargling\" - like noises.  then i thought \"what the hell is going on\"? i was a bit dazed. after i heard their communication, i again... woke up. the last thing i saw was a hand coming close to my eyes.  that was the last dream i had about this.. after that i kept drawing things of my dream experience. i do not know anyone with this effect. my sister and brother were also witnesses of the UFO incident that we saw in July 1st, 2003. i asked them if they had nightmare of aliens or ufos or being abducted. they replied with a \"No\" i guess i was the only one affected. Also, i never met anyone who has gone through this. however, i did see people on television with this same experiences ; \"Seeing a UFO, then having ufo nightmares of being abducted in their dreams\" after seeing this in television i was shocked.. the t.v. program was called \"unexplained mysteries\"  that is all i can remember for now. please i would like to keep my self annonymous. I did NOT make this up, i didn\\'t type all this for the \"hell of it\" and spent my time in it for nothing.. ALL that was typed above was my personal experience.. I do not have any fotographs of the craft i saw.. i just have sketches and drawings of the craft i saw in july 1st 2003 and sketches/drawings of the creatures i saw in my dreams.. thank you for reading and listening.  as i said above.. i want to keep my self Annonymous.',\n",
       "       \"I was 5 years old and in my parent's  bedroom. i was looking out the window across the street and i saw something weird shaped like a saucer that was dark blue with red, yellow, green, and blue lights each flashing at the same time. after 5 seconds,it passed the window. i told my dad , but he did'nt listen to me. he just said it was 10 o'clock P.M. and i should go back to sleep. when i looked back again, it was gone.  3 years later, that memory is still really creepy when i look back at it. but this time, when i see it again and it starts abducting people, I'll panic.

       "       \"Multiple red llights in a row sighted  from my home in Antioch , Calif. On New Years Eve night me and three other friends went outside at midnight to bring in the New Year. We had some confetti we were trying to throw into the air and after I heard alot of fireworks go off in the distance.  That caught my attention to look to the left of me and I saw four reddish orange circular lights appear out of no where.  I told everyone else to look up to the left as well and we all saw the same thing.   We couldn't figure out what it was.  They were all four in a row .  Then all of the suddne a fifth one entered from the left side of the formation.  They stayed there for what seemed about five minutes then they all just disapeared at the same time into the dark like magic they were gone!!  It was quite strange.  Never had we seen anything like this.  However there have been quite a few sightings of other things in this general area of Antioch, Pittsburg , and Oakley, Calif.  A few friends of my family have actually had a UFO hover over them in their cars .  That was really strange as well.  They were so shook up they thought for sure they were going to be abducted.  Lots of real life stories out here.  I have had alot of ghosts in my houses out this way as well.  The police said they have even seen them and have had so many calls about strange things happening  in their homes.  My last home that a sold at least five more families have moved into it just to move out again.  I know why !!!\",\n",
       "       'Attempted abduction [?] of 2 people in Suburban Bike Trail by a U.F.O. I reported another UFO incident on 4/16/2007 in North Riverside on here and it IS posted, I have since then try and put that out of my mind but recently a friend and I were walking back home through the local bike trail and out of nowhere an extremely bright white light hovered about tree level above us for 3-4 seconds and my friend and I could not move! The light was so intense and the whole ground around us lit up like it was day time! There are NO lights in the bike trail and it was not an airplane,helicopter,or a meteor. After it disappeared my friend and I ran as fast as we could to the nearest exit,we will never go back into the bike trail again. I swear to god  that this really happened. I have a picture of the previous reports UFO and it looks to me that it could have very well been the same thing that shined its light on us that night!

       "       \"UFOs abduct me  I was driving along the pacific Highway i was listening to the radio until my car stopped working. I went out of my car to see if anything was wrong with my car. Suddenly I saw a blinding white light. I saw five crafts (UFOs) the largest one about 50m in diameter in the middle and 4 small other crafts half the size of the large one moving around like they were guarding the middle one. I was scared yet interested  as i looked more closely I accidently hit the car horn witch seemed to have worked. As soon I pressed the horn the 4 small crafts stopped moving and they shot 4 white beams at the middle craft till the middel craft turned bright white. Then a black circle appeared from the centre of the craft then a black beam shot at me and I coudn't remember anything else. I woke up inside my car 3:30AM. I went back home and decided to have a shower as I was stripping off my clothes I saw that I was somehow branded I had a sort of green tatoo which had one large circle with 4 small circles around it. A I went to the shower I noticed that I had all of my pubic hair missing. When I finised having my shower I went to inspect that tatoo but it wasn't there anymore.\",\n",
       "       'I saw a real something in the sky. Clear as a bell and very interesting The object was round. It looked as if it was spinning. Silver with flashes of light. Like a ball of spinning mercury. It was hovering over the house on the next rural block. Silent! It was a clear wonderfull morning. The background was the mountains so it shown very clear. This area is well known for activity. It is not the first time I have witnessed activity, but, the most disturbing. This sounds strange, but it noticed me. I noticed it. I felt a bit of mental presure. Sounds crazy I know. I was not scared, just concerned. The object was there for at least 5 min. I had time to call my partner and tell him. At one point it looked as if it was heading my way. This is when I felt the mental presure. My partner yelled at me to get the camera. My dogs had been unusually quiet untill now. All 10 started to howl (I have an informal dog rescue and no we are not trashy people). This is the point it started to head west into the mountains slowly. I went to get the camera and by the time I got it running, the object was gone.  This is stranger. I started to get confused soon after this. I had to stop and center myself. I felt strange. I am a person who is never a victim of life, but I started to get confused and a bit forgetfull, like I wanted to, a bit of mental time slipage? I called my best friend. We talked. I felt fine. I then laid down for a nap with my dogs. I am o.k. I did not lose any time, but I did feel affected. I refuse to let them take me from the light.  In retrospect. I think it was doing something over there. Something happened or an exchange took place, something not very nice. My gut is never wrong. I went over to talk to the neighbors. They refused to talk to me. This is rural desert, so that behavior is not unexpected. This is an area next to Goat Mountain and Giant Rock. The Integratron is not far away and 29 Palms Base is right to the east. The unusual weather, paranormal, and sightings are not uncommon during the year I have been here. I have personally talked to people who have been \"abducted\" in this area. We also see a lot of orbs as of late. I have been told we will have a quake soon by oldtimers. But, that is an other story.  While I have the stage. I believe something big is going on. That is for sure. To all my friends out there. Hold yourself in the light (I am a Quaker). Center your self. I know people who have been very affected by events such as this and worse. This is our life, our world. Some call it prayer. Whatever, just empower your self. Do not be scared. Bad things are happening, also good too. You are not crazy. Do not be a victim. Best of luck.  Please forgive any grammer and spelling mistakes.  Thank you, DM',\n",
       "       'THe ufo was a triangle and it tryed to abduct me and it happend before 8 years ago. The UFO appeared at 21:33 left at 21:39 and then returned exactly one hour later and left exactly one hour after the last time it left. It was a triangle shaped craft with lights on the tips of the triangle. The lights were a mix of these colors, red, maroon, orange and yellow. The body of the craft was black. It came from the west and was moving east. It was large, it was bigger than any airplane or I had ever seen and it made a small humming noise. The size of the craft would have been he size of a baseball field. The craft was able to distort radio waves and cell phone frequencies. It caused a lot of static on radios and on my cell phone. There were chirping noises coming from my radio in the static. My cell phone had a lot of static. I was on the phone with a family member telling him about it and he may have seen it. It was able to mess with any electrical appliances that were left on. It had my watch on my hand going off the fritz. The second hand kept spinning forward and eventually stopped after it left. My camera even had static on it. I am mailing what I saw on the camera lcd screen. It looked like they were hailing me on my camera like on the show star trek. The weirdest part of the experience is the effect it had on my 5 cats. All five cats came into the room I was in. I even had one locked in my room and it opened the door to get out there. The cats circled me as I was gazing at the object. The object was slowly moving over my house and there was another flying object behind it and it was much smaller like a manmade aircraft chasing it. That aircraft did not make any sound and when it came close to the UFO it left for approximately one hour. I had sent in an earlier report and I mixed up the times by three hours. It happened at dark and the lights of the craft were the only things that could easily be seen. It was spinning clockwise the entire time and when it was hovering over the house. I tried to go outside but my cats would not let me. It came back an hour latter and the! same re sults with electrical devices were happening. I was on the phone with my girlfriend and it went static, I went out to the room and I saw the ufo coming from northwest going southwest towards my house it looked like it was going to collide and then it went invisible and the cats started hissing at something I could not even see in the room. There was a constant humming sound in the room until the cats hissed then it went away again and did not come back. This happened before in September 8 years ago on the 23. The same thing happened then. That was when I was 8 years old, half my life in the past. I think they were going to try and take me.',\n",
       "       \"four large greenish hazy lights, in straight line formation, moving very fast, no sound Time sighted: 2044 EST, Thursday, April 10, 2008  Location: Greenville, North Carolina, USA  Duration of sighting: approximately 12 to 15 seconds  Sky conditions: Very clear, stars visible and distinct, the moon a one quarter crescent just above the formation, scattered low small thin clouds. I was sitting on my patio facing west.  At 2045 by my watch which is one minute faster than the official U.S. time, I observed four lights going from southwest to northeast, from my 11 o'clock to 2 o'clock position, at elevation about one half way between the horizon and directly overhead.  The lights were four abreast at first, top to bottom from my perspective and eqi-distant apart, which I thought was unusual for military aircraft.  If you hold your hand at arms length with your thumb and first finger about three inches apart, that would encompass the formation.  There was only one light per object and they were not blinking.  Each light was maybe three to four times the size of Venus, with a faintly greenish tinge, and appeared not distinct, but slightly hazy like looking through a fog.  They went through about twenty degrees of the sky and then one light dropped back into trail.  After going through another twenty degrees, they disappeared behind a cloud.  They traveled in a straight line.  The entire sighting lasted about twelve seconds.  I expected to hear sounds of jet engines following the lights, but heard nothing.  There was no vapor trail like I observed on other normal aircraft seen later. For many years, I have done a lot of fishing at night.  I have observed many aircraft flying overhead and have seen many shooting stars.  This was like nothing I have ever seen before and immediately caught my attention.  The unusual formation, speed, and lack of sound were unique.  To cross the sky that quickly, they had to be relatively low but I heard no sound.  If they were too high to be heard, they were going many times faster than other planes I have observed and were extremely large.  It was definitely not the ubiquitous weather balloon. To our south about thirty miles is Seymour Johnson AFB.  I was stationed there in the mid-60’s and am familiar with military planes.  Their F-15’s often fly over Greenville since their runway has a north-south heading.  They are generally low enough to be heard.  We also see the louder F-18's out of Virginia Beach.  Most aircraft have red, green, and white lights.  On most airplanes you can usually see blinking lights or rotating strobes and not all lights are visible from every direction.  The four lights I saw were steady and looked the same from a left to right forty degree arc.  Pitt-Greenville Airport is about four miles away to my northwest.  I worked there for three years ending two years ago.  Again I never saw anything like this during that time. About me.  I am sixty-four years old and retired.  I was in the air force four years, worked at Eastern Airlines for twelve, and was in computing for thirty-five years, the last eighteen with a university.  I do not believe in UFO’s, little green men, or alien abductions.  But I will admit that this was like nothing I’ve ever seen before and it was interesting.  I’d like to know what I really saw.\",\n",

       "       'UFO hovering 10-20 feet above houses in small Washington State neighborhood Friday, March 28, 2008, 5:40AM Pacific, Washington (15 miles south of Seattle: 10 miles north of Tacoma)  Upon waking up this morning, I stepped outside of my back door (facing south). At which point I was surprised to see an object hovering about 20 feet above my next door neighbor’s house. The object was black and had 2 lights on each side of the front of it. The sky was black and the object was black so it was difficult to see exactly how large it was, but the part of the object that I did see, was approx. 3 times larger than the house that it hovered over. The house is a basic one floor single family unit. I did see that the object was black, but I could not make out the exact shape of the object. (I’m positive it was ‘cloaked’ in some way. The object also had 2 white lights on its front side. They were spaced out, spanning the approx. size of the house under it. I don’t think they spanned to the exact sides of the craft. They were closer together than that.  When I stepped outside of the door and noticed the object, it seemed to have noticed me at the same time. It began moving very slowly over to my house (in my estimation, approx. 2 miles per hour).  At that point, I ran back into my house. It felt as though it had targeted me.  As, I walked through my kitchen, I saw the object over my yard, and moving to the top of my house. Again, it was moving very slowly, as if it were in a ‘hovering movement state’. I then watched it move from the side of my house to the top of my house. I could not longer see it at that point, as it was on top of my house. Again, it hovered not more than 20 feet above my house. Perhaps it hovered even lower than that.  It was then, that I ran into my son’s room and told him about it. He wanted to go look at it and would have seen it, but I was afraid that it was coming to my house because it possibly had the intentions of abducting a human (and there we were.. ), so I wouldn’t allow my son to go out to look at it, for fear that he would be abducted.  I hid for about 30 minutes... then I felt ok again. I went to bed. Approx. 30 minutes after I got into bed, I saw the UFO once again (out of my bedroom window, to the south). This time it was rapidly flying away from my neighborhood. It was flying south (towards Tacoma). I could not determine its size. But I did see all of its lights. I will try to draw the pattern below:   \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t*   \\t\\t\\t*\\t\\t\\t\\t*   \\t\\t*\\t\\t\\t*\\t\\t\\t*   \\t\\t\\t*\\t\\t\\t\\t*   \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t*  The lights were pulsing brightly at approx. 5 second intervals. When they pulsed brightly, they actually became almost one light and I had to close my eyes as a result of the brightness. Mind you, the object was approx. 1 to 2 miles away at that point. I watched the object fly over and up (to an area of the sky) where there was a round white light enshrouded by a thick black cloud (the cloud receded occasionally, in the same manner that clouds recede and thicken). When the cloud receded I could see that the white light looked exactly like the moon. Mind you, this was approx. 6 or 6:15 AM. The moon does not shine outside of my bedroom window at that time of the morning. (I am absolutely positive, as I watch it constantly). The object that I was watching seemed to fly up to the cloud where the \"moon\" was residing  This is when the object disappeared. The ‘moon’ went behind the black cloud. It stayed dark for at least 10 minutes and I didn’t watch to see if it showed up again after that. Curiously, I have been seeing this ‘moon’ at odd times (2am, 3am) during the night for the past week or so. I don’t know if it has anything to do with the object that I saw, but it was a very odd sight. This is a true report. I am a professional. I have worked IT for the past 15 years and before that I was the Director of a HUD program for 10 years.',\n",

       "       'A man and his two kids see a clear UFO less than a mile away during an autumn evening in Austin, Texas.  Dazed deer present. I’ve had 6 sightings in my life, but none as good as this one. I had recently sold my car, where I kept a nice set of binoculars for the sole purpose of looking at a UFO closer if and when I saw another one, and was now driving the family van with my two kids on our way to get gasoline, and then to the store.   This particular evening was fairly clear, and, as I was driving down a slightly winding street to get onto a major street, I saw an orange object just above the tree line that, during the brief moment I had to see it, first made me think of the moon when it\\'s low on the horizon and has an orange glow, the way it looks during an lunar eclipse.  However, I felt that the moon should be a bigger, and also that it wasn\\'t in the direction of the sky where the moon usually is, so I looped around the other neighborhood streets and came back up the same street, slower, to get a second look. Sure enough, when I saw it again, there was no mistaking it, it was definitely a hovering UFO similar to one whose picture was taken on December 21, 1994, by Carlos Diaz, so I turned off my headlights, came to a stop where I had the best view, lowered the windows, and turned off the van. Believe me when I tell you that based on the terrain of this area, even though it\\'s surrounded by houses, businesses, a high school, and a very busy major street, where this UFO was hovering was not observable except for about 50 yards on this one street where I was parked. I told my kids to look at the object, and told them it was a spaceship.  They were 3 and 5 years old at the time, and though innocent, they were very interested in hearing about a real spaceship, especially because they were fans of the movie Toy Story. The object was not a thin disk or cigar shaped.  Honestly, it looked a lot more like a slightly squashed lemon, except with two \"nipples\" on either side instead of a stem on one side and a nipple on the other.  It glowed a uniform orange, and it had white beacon lights, one on top, and one on the bottom, across its perpendicular axis.  It had a row of very small white lights across its horizontal axis, dividing the craft equally above and below.  The beacon lights were blinking about 3 times per second but not in sync with each other.  The object was about 3 stories off the ground, and less than a mile away from us, but I really can\\'t estimate the exact distance.  I would say somewhere between half a mile and a mile.  I could not make out any more detail, and believe me; I REALLY missed not having my binoculars that day. I had a red laser pointer on me that I use at work, and my son asked me to point it at the object, but I ignored him.  He happened to have a flashlight that he\\'d gotten recently in his pocket, so before I knew it, he had taken it out and turned it on to point it at \"them\".  I moved his arm down, gently, but he could see I was being cautious.  He asked why I didn\\'t want to signal them, and I said that I wasn\\'t sure it was a good idea.  In my mind, I was thinking, \"I don\\'t know if they are good or bad, and I don\\'t want to inadvertently volunteer my kids to become regular abductees.\"  I was also thinking, \"Man, if only my kids weren\\'t here, I\\'d get out of this van and run to get a closer look, but I\\'m trapped under these circumstances.\"  Anyway, to make a long story short, we watched this object for at least 3 minutes, and it was just hovering there, so in my impatience to get a closer look, I remembered a business parking lot that was adjacent (left of the object from our point of view) to the forest that this object was hovering over, and I thought, \"If I time the signal light properly, I can quickly race the van to make the left turn, go down a block or two into the business parking lot, and then drive to the edge of the parking lot closest to the object. Perhaps from there I can see it closer through the trees\", so without hesitating much, that\\'s what I did.  As I raced the van and the trees blocked my view, the last glimpse I caught of the object was that it was still hovering in the same place, so I was very hopeful of being able to get a better look. However, when I got into the business parking lot, I found a big surprise - there were no less than 50, and probably more like 100 deer in the parking lot, and they were in a dazed, almost frozen state.  They moved very little, to the point that I had to steer around a few of them to avoid hitting them.  That in itself was remarkable, and only reinforced my belief that this object was not human-made, that the occupants had somehow put these deer in a trance.   After finally getting to where I thought I could see the object, I was disappointed to find out that I could not see it anywhere, so as fast as I could, again avoiding the deer in my way, I worked my way back to where I was before, and unfortunately the object was now gone.   After this event, my son drew a picture of what he saw, and it was essentially what I saw.  Both my children still remember the event, even though my daughter was so young, perhaps because we\\'ve retold it several times, but I certainly don\\'t want them to forget it. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Mr. Davenport, I have the drawing somewhere in a box in the attic or inside a book, but I can\\'t remember where exactly, and it\\'s been over 7 years now since the incident.  If I ever run into it, I\\'ll scan it and send it to you.   My apologies for not having kept better records.  I considered contacting an investigator from MUFON way back then to check woods below where the object was hovering, but I never did.  I was no willing to put my children in any type of danger. I still keep my eye out in the sky, so if I ever catch anything again, I\\'ll also send it your way. ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM))',\n",
       "       'I have been seeing the same ufo since my first report and it is stalking me and my girlfriend. I saw the triangle again; I have reported the same thing several times before and never had anyone call me. It has been stalking me since my first ufo report and it visited me when I was 8. I am 16 now. I was in Fort Collins for vacation for the last week until 7-24-07. I saw the triangle in fort Collins Colorado the same time as the triangle in St. Louis that I have been seeing. It is following me everywhere. In Fort Collins there was also fireballs in the sky. There was a red one and 4 white ones chasing each other in the sky until the triangle showed up at the time 21:33. They all scattered and then when I got my dad, the triangle left but the fireballs were still chasing each other until and aircraft flew by and then they were gone. Then today 7-25-07 the day I’m back from Fort Collins Colorado the same Triangle I saw in Colorado and before came back and dived toward me and I ran for my dad to run out side, then when he came out the triangle went away. I am always on the phone with my girlfriend when the triangle appears. She has even seen the triangle before, and she reported the ufo in North Carolina on the beach. The triangle is what she reported. I keep seeing it when I’m on the phone with her and then she will call me a few minutes latter after the UfO jamms my cell phone to say she is seeing the same thing. IT is scary and I think it is trying to abduct me. I have 5 cats. I think they aliens are not abducting me when I go inside because I have cats. The ship will hover over me when I am away from my cats but when I go and get near one the thing disappears.',\n",
       "       \"UFO lights over Minnesota River in Burnsville that resemble the Phoenix lights. I am a female and I'm 26 years old.  My brother who is the other witness is 19 years old.  I have seen UFO's before, but nothing like this.  It was about 7:15pm, the sun was down, but it was still a little light out. I was driving back home on 35W with my brother and I noticed a bright light in the sky. I'm so used to seeing jets and airplanes around here, I know what they look like in the sky, but this light was much different. Well as we were getting closer to home I noticed another light, then a couple seconds later another one appeared and I noticed they all formed a weird triangle formation. Well trees got in the way and I couldn't see the UFO's any more. Well about ten minutes later my jaw just dropped to the floor, because I saw five lights all spaced out equally and they were in a slight V-shape formation. Right away I thought of the Phoenix Lights, because I do remember what they looked liked. Now I knew these had to be UFO's and I got all excited. I told my brother to look and I told him that there is no way that those are jets, because they were too close together. My brother was just as amazed as I was and he wanted to take some pictures, so we took our exit and went straight to this service road that brought us closer to the lights. We pulled in a parking lot since it was uphill and we could get a better view. I noticed two other lights as I pulled into the parking lot but they were not part of the formation. We got out of my car and I took a couple pictures with my cellphone. We were facing north and we could see Downtown Minneapolis from where we were.  The UFO's were hovering above or at least along the banks of the Minnesota River, it was hard to tell. The whole formation was about a mile across. That's my best guest. I noticed that there was one UFO that was brighter than the rest and it was right in the middle. The color was a very bright golden-white.  I could see three seperate lights from that UFO, but the lights were so bright it looked like one. The rest of the UF! O's were n't as bright as this one, but they were of the same color. The UFO's didn't move forward or backwards. They just stayed there for five minutes or so and then they moved up or down, but just a little bit. We watched them for about 20mins and the formation changed a couple of times. Then all of a sudden one UFO that was on end of the right side moved out of formation and was moving slowly toward us. On this UFO I could see that it also had about three lights. I almost thought it was a airplane because of it's size, but then the lights weren't flashing and it looked like a boomerang? My brother got scared thinking that we were going to get abducted by this UFO and he wanted me to drive out of there. We got back in the car and I drove back home. I wanted to go back there and take better pictures with my digital camera. We only live five minutes from the parking lot, so I figured we would have some time to see them again. I got the camera and we went back to the parking lot. Sure enough they were still there! The time was around 8pm and there were just four lights. Now the brightest of the UFO's, the one in the middle drifted off and did it's own thing for a minute or so and then it went back to the middle again. I used my camera to take some pictures, but it came out crappy. I also video taped it, but that didn't come out as nice either. After I felt I couldn't get any good pictures from where we were, I decided to drive closer. I went back to 35W going north and as I was crossing the Minnesota River I looked to my right and I could see the UFO that was once in the middle of the formation, the really bright UFO I mentioned before. Since I was closer to the UFO I could see that the color of the light was a super bright white, the brightest light I have ever seen in my life. The best way I can describe the brightness is that it was like stadium lights. It also was hovering very low near the river. To me it looked like it was searching for something, because it was so low. I later heard from my mom that some t! ime in t he afternoon some people around the Twin Cities reported a metallic or flaming ball in the sky and some reported hearing a loud boom. My other brother has told me that some UFO's appear during or after a meteor?? If anyone is interested in my story or would like to help me figure out how I could get my video and or pictures in better quality, please contact me! Thanks! P.S. The two pictures have not been messed with and they are small in size since I took them with my cell phone and as for the video, I used my digital camera. I hope to at least get the video in better quality.  P.S. The whole UFO event lasted about an hour and a half.  From about 7:15pm to 8:45pm.\",\n",

       "       '2 UFO\\'s spotted over Hooper, Colorado On Saturday, July 28th, 2007, there was a group of approx. 50 people attending a gathering at the UFO Watchtower, which is located near Hooper, CO.  The area is well known for it\\'s frequent UFO sightings and abductions, and because of this is known as \"Abduction Alley\". The sky that day was partly cloudy.  At first I saw a white object among the clouds which was moving in a completely different manner than the surrounding clouds.  It moved out to where the sky was bright blue and it was very clearly visible.  After approx. 2-3 minutes it separated from another craft to reveal that there were actually 2 UFO\\'s, then they both vanished.  They were disc shaped with something pointed coming out of the top of the crafts. In addition to seeing the crafts that day, many people\\'s watches and cell phones changed to the incorrect time.',\n",
       "       'Strange lights at first thought to be shooting stars. A few nights ago I awoke from a particularly bad case of sleep paralysis around 3am when I heard the sound of several neighborhood dogs barking, something was obviously disturbing them. This lead me to look out my bedroom window to investigate. I then saw what at first appeared to be shooting stars in the sky. While I was wondering why there were so many of them or why they were so frequent, i then realized they were not shooting stars at all. These objects would fly one direction, then suddenly turn in another. Some would hover still for a few seconds. Every now and then I\\'d see one \"flash\" then shoot off in a direction at incredible speed. I must point out that these objects did seem to be flying rather randomly. In fact, I later joked to my girlfriend \"if they were aliens, well they were obviously driving drunk\". The lights do however seem to occasionally \"interact\" with one another, flying near to each other, hovering then flying away. These lights were visible outside my window until I fell asleep at 6am. For the most part I heard no sound connected with the objects, although I did often hear the sound of helicopters - far more frequently then i would normally in my area. I saw a helicopter only once, it did match the description of \"black helicopters\" that I have read. Being somewhat of a skeptic, as well as being aware of the effects of sleep paralysis - I at first put off these lights to being hypnagognic hallucination. This explanation, however was proven wrong when tonight I saw the same thing, also shortly after 3am. This time my sighting was not following sleep and my girlfriend was over and saw them too. Also, tonight at one point I saw a much larger and much brighter light. This light suddenly appeared in the sky, and then moved slowly to the left. I called in my girlfriend who saw it and became rather frightened. I turned to comfort her and upon me turning back, it was gone. These lights are visible outside my window now. I am aware many times alien abductions have been explained away as sleep paralysis. The fact that I had sleep paralysis before my first time witnessing these lights has me wondering if the two are in fact connected somehow. This is why I am checking the \"possible UFO abduction case\" box below. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))',\n",
       "       \"Large, White, Round Ball While out hunting with a friend, we saw a ufo while driving to another hunting area.   I immediately noticed it was different.  It was a large, round, white object.  It was large and it was flying a perfect, straight path, over the north side of the city where there is a lot of new construction taking place.   It didn't follow the normal flight patterns, as it was headed towards the GF airport.  It held a perfect, perpendicular flight path.   When the object got closer the airport, it disappeared.   I have seen ufo's before and I am constantly looking for them in the sky when I am outside.  I saw one back home in 1992, with my wife, in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.  I also saw one in Burlington County, New Jersey, outside McGuire AFB.   I was out with my wife the night after September 11th, 2001.  We went to Wal-Mart to get some stuff that we needed and to stimulate the economy in any small way we could.  When we were driving back, and neared the Military base, we saw three black, triangular shaped objects.  All three aircraft had round, bright lights at all three points.  They were moving slowly and rotated at the same time.  There was no noise being generated, it was completely quiet.   I pulled the car over, got out, walked around the car and into the field.  It was awesome, I was so happy to see them.  I wanted to run out into the field to get a better look, but my wife started freaking out, telling me to geat back in the car or she was going to leave without me.   A few days later we found out that the flight line at McGuire AFB was shut down and F-16 fighters were sent out to investigate, freaky!   Talk about an awesome experience, great!   Some might think I'm nuts, but I still think I was abducted when I was a young boy.  I love looking for UFO's, and if I see more I'll let you know.

       "       \"We saw six UFOs on that night. It was really freaky... It was freaky sleeping afterwards. **NOTE: We didn't see all six UFOs at once.**  At about 10:45, I sent my younger cousin downstairs to ask his mother if we could go outside to watch for UFOs. We've seen them before while looking up into the night sky, so why not look again? Anyway, she said no at first. So we just sat on the bed, then the twins were acting up and the mother was angry. She was trying to get them to bed, since they were only six years old. I finally talked her into letting us go outside. So we sat on the chairs outside at about 11:00 PM. We sat there looking up for a while. We were talking about dreams about aliens and UFOs and the such. About the Roswell incident, about the government and them making deals with aliens. Suddenly, my older cousin sees a white, round light moving in the sky. I would've thought it was just a plane or something like that, but it wasn't making any noise. Nor was it blinking. We just sat there looking at it move across the sky. Then all of a sudden, it disappeared! We didn't see anything after that, so we went over to another spot. Then, one of the freakiest things happened; We saw 5 of the same lights moving. They were a bit dull, but were still visible. They were moving, shifting directions, passing each other up... real freaky stuff. Then, it gets freakier, they all disappear. Not all at the same time, but they do. We can't see anything after that, so we sit down and talk about aliens and UFOs and stuff. And then my older cousin said something that freaked the hell out of me: People who see UFOs have a much bigger chance of getting abducted than someone who haven't seen one.\",\n",
       "       \"((NUFORC Note:  We have no way to certify that this report is either sincere, or accurate.  PD)) I reported the UFO sighting in Pawtucket R.I.of 1974 that you have on your website.  My sister and my brother would like to get a interview to talk about the craft in secret to protect our identity.  There is more to that experience that I felt I should share the rest of it now to your organization.  I left out the part to my abduction into the craft  My father still owns that house property with the 3 door flat top garage.  I was hoping if some how a team of your investigatrs can go and do a radio active reading on the roof.  The orginal beams our still in place supported by beams of wood my father had anchored to the damaged ones from the ufo landing.  Now here comes the shocking abduction story.  I was brought into the craft by two small aliens that stood at my eye level but with such strong strenght they shoved me into a room with a metalic table off to the side of the small room.  The lights in the room had a blue silvery incandescent glow.  A Female alien try to set me at ease by communicating to me not by speech.  I know this sounds off the wall but by telecommunication that we've seen in science fiction movies.  She said that they came from another world unknown to us and they plan on not hurting me but would like to perform some quick test's on me, I was frighented and tryed not to look at her large grey piercing eye's.  She said please disrobe from your clothing and I shook my head in fright.  It was icy cold in the craft it felt as if I was in the cold outside in the snow.  Then from behind her another alien came walking in and he seemed to be a little angry in the fact that I was still in my winter coat and clothing and was not yet even placed on the metal table for what ever they had in mind.  The female alien then said. look what you have done BoBo is now angry at me allowing you to waste precious time.  BoBo the alien who seems to be in charge looked at her angerly and said why did you reveal my name to this human ! boy.  She quickly than appologized and said look what you've d! one he i s now angry again at me.  He walked over to me and she said he is only a small boy he will not remember your name.  Getting away from this ufo encounter from that day on anytime I heard the name bozo or hobo I would feel a chill go up my spine until later on in life I remembered his name and realized why.  I noticed in the craft a engraved picture of a whale on it and it seemed to relaxed my mind a little because everything else in the craft looked alien to me and not reconizable. Bobo noticing I was transfixed on the whale asked me telepathically do you know what that is a picture of I nodded no in fright looking at his taller slender body with a large bulbus head because I was to scared to make conversation with any of them.  He laughed and said when I was your age I had already the intelliegence of five of your highly respected scientists.  The female alien then interrupted him and said that's not true.  You had the intellegence of 2 of their respected scientists.  That i! s true, maybe I am not giving your kind to much credit because I find you humans to be so ignorant and primitive you have so much to learn about your planet and about yourselves.  All this what you call war towards others.  He noticed that I started to look puzzled and stopped talking about what he thought of humans.  He than pointed to the picture and said that is a blue whale.  That is the symbol we use to identify your planet here in the milky way galaxie.  These whales when they communicate to one another in your blue ocean can be heard millions of light years away to our planet.  Their sound waves travel up onto iceburgs working like a radio wave and reached us millions of years ago and we followed the sounds here to your planet.  I am getting tiered typing this e-mail now and will wait to see if you would like a interview where I can share a whole lot more.  I must say I am glad the goverment keeps all ufo information hidden because what I saw can be mind bottling and! scary for most humans that our weak minded citizens could cau! se great stress in how humans think and excell in life knowing that their our intelligent beings way more advanced then us but the good thing is we have God and that is another subject I will talk about.  One quick data I did some reasurch and believe the craft I was abducted in was the ufo that crashed in Chihuahua, Mexico on 8/25/1974. It has the same discription that I reported and learned of this craft this year watching the new tv show on the History channel UFO Encounters.\",\n",
       "       'Bright light sucking water and splashing with 2 legged hairy spider like monsters with wet black eyes   I was camping near a lake with a fellow scout.  I was awakened by splashing noises and water smells.  I looked out my tent door and saw a bright light gliding over the lake sucking up the water.  I was curious and frightened.  I laid face down and watched the light move over the water.  I started to worry about it and tried to wake up my tent partner. I could not wake him from his sleep and moved back towards the tent door but stopped.  I saw hairy 2 legged monsters.  I backed away from the tent door but could still see their images because the light was now closer.  I don\\'t remember much more except that I have unending dreams of being pulled into the lake and emerging inside a cavern under the lake.  There was air, but it was hard to breathe it and I could see moving shadows.  The inside of the cavern had some kind of light source. In my dream I pulled out my scout flashlight with the rubber seal and point it toward the shadows and see spider like creatures, ! but hairy with tall thin legs. My light bothers them; I don\\'t know why the light is an irritant.But, they move to my left and right as though they try to surround me. My flashlight dims over time and now I can see their wet black eyes. I hold back my tears and try to shout but I can\\'t hear myself. Exhausted and with little light left they stick me with their pointy legs and smother my breath. I always wake up the same way I did that same morning after, soaked with sweat or lake water; I can\\'t tell which.  I am scared to death every night I sleep, because I know they come in my dreams and I can\\'t stop them.  I must tell you that I see myself like them in the mirror on occasion only to second look myself and see me normal again. I believe I was abducted but can\\'t prove it. I was just a boy then and now I am in my 50\\'s and still I am bothered with this horrible dream.  10 years ago I had a tumor removed from my body.  It was attached to my stomach. It weighed about a pound and! was about the size of a small orange.  The doctor said it was! an unus ual size and sent it to the lab for biopsy. That lab was flooded and the tumor was lost.  I have always wondered if that tumor was a spider sack?  I guess I will never know. If anyone has had similar dreams, I\\'d like to know?  I do have these red splotchy spots on my legs that my doctor says is a rash.  I have had them for decades. These spots end at the knee. Maybe some one else form your index has the same and we could share.  I am old fashioned when it comes to computers.

       "       'UFO orbs appear during intense MCV thunderstorm I\\'m senior in college at Missouri State University.  I was sleeping in because it was dead day, Friday May 8, which is always study day the Friday before finals.  I was woken up by tornado sirens and a really terrible thunderstorm at 9am.  The power was also out.  We get really bad thunderstorms but this one took the cake.  From www.weather.com/newscenter/stormwatch/:  \"MCV becomes - Inland Hurricane:  May 8, 2009 brought a derecho, a widespread windstorm associated with a bow echo thunderstorm complex, along a 600-mile-long, 60-mile wide swath across southeast KS, south MO, and south IL. Many of the damaging winds were not with the leading line of severe thunderstorm, but rather behind it and beneath a mid-level rotation center called an MCV - mesoscale convective vortex. Winds gusted to 106 mph. At least 220,000 customers lost power in MO and IL. The system spawned more than 30 tornadoes, at 20 of them in southwest MO. EF3 tornadoes hit Howell County MO and Garrard County KY.\"  This storm was crazy.  It was pounding my off campus apartment.  I could hear pieces of metal siding being ripped off the building.  It was the weirdest thing...the winds were blowing straight at the building, driving the rain around the edges of the sliding glass door and spraying my living room with water.  I was freaking out.  It was very intense, and I was frantically trying to figure out how to keep the water out.  The winds began to calm down a bit, and I was running around my apartment trying to find the memory card to my camera.  I\\'m a sort of an amateur meteorologist and love taking storm photos.  I\\'m a photography and graphic design major, and I have a Canon 40d with a number of lenses, including a solid zoom 100-400mm L.  However, I couldn\\'t find my 16gb memory card and nearly ripped my apartment apart trying to find it.  I couldn\\'t even find my backup 4gb card, which was odd, because its always in my bag.  After several minutes of frantic searching, I stopped for some reason, in my living room, turned to my right, and out the back sliding glass door window was the weirdest sight.  It was like an orb shaped thing, combined with a fireball, perhaps a few miles in the distance hovering beyond the middle school behind my apartment.  It was really weird because it seemed to be wiggly...like it had waves coming off of it that were vibrating.  It was bright white, and the edges seemed to be yellowish orange.  The first thing I thought was that something exploded in mid air, and this is where my memory is a little fuzzy because I\\'m reporting this many months later (which I\\'ll explain soon).  I\\'m pretty sure that another one appeared on the sides of it, which made me think it was an aircraft.  Sometimes aircraft fly under thunderstorms to avoid the dangerous updrafts.  But the way the lights radiated was just too weird.  Then they each disappeared, one by one, quickly.  What ticked me ! off the most was that even though I had my camera around my neck, I couldn\\'t take a photo!  Gaaahh!  Ridiculous.  So I grab my iPhone, text my fiance and roommate to tell them what happened, and then looked up Springfield\\'s airport website to find arrival / departure times.  There were no planes landing near the time that I saw the lights, and Springfield, being a small town of 150k, it doesn\\'t get many large aircraft landing during the day.  Also the lights didn\\'t seem to be moving in any direction, and if they were coming head on, that wouldn\\'t make any sense either, because the airport is on the NE fringe of town and I was right in the middle of town, and even though its a small town, its spread out over 88 square miles because they don\\'t know how to build up in these small towns.  The other explanation would be ball lightning, which hasn\\'t been scientifically proven to exist, but has been observed by many people in the past.  So here is some background info on why I\\'m posting this so far after the fact: tonight I was watching UFO Hunters on the History channel and they showed these orbs on there that have been occuring in the Ozarks around Springfield this year and some of the video and artist\\'s renditions looked a lot like what I saw and it freaked me out.  I didn\\'t get the same feeling of dread when I saw it that other people have reported, but I did feel like I was frozen and couldn\\'t move.  It was pretty wild.  They also reported about a light on the north side of town, and I also believe I have seen this light before when driving back in forth to Bolivar, MO to see my friends at SBU.  It just seems too bright and out of place for that area of the sky and I only notice it sometimes.  I feel like I have a fairly solid grasp of astronomy, having taken a college course where we had to learn about heavenly objects and went out to Baker Observatory (which ironically is near Marshfield, where on UF! O hunters a highway patrolman reported an orb following him) on several occasions to observe the night sky.  My dad was also an amateur astronomer when I was younger and we would go outside and look at the stars frequently.  I\\'m also not a crazy UFO person, but a fairly rational college student.  However, I feel like I have some sort of odd connection with UFOs.  When I was in elementary school I would have horrible horrible night terrors of being abducted by aliens and when I was in 10th grade, I had another encounter I\\'d like to share.  Feel free to remove this for the reporting post but I want to submit it along with this for completeness:  My best friend and I were driving home late on a Thursday night from the movies near midnight, which was my curfew in 10th grade.  My best friend is very smart, an Eagle Scout and a member of the Stretch program at school for highly intelligent students.  We were both in advanced placement programs for math and literature.   Since it was so long ago (2001-2002?) I can\\'t remember the date at all. We were waiting at a red light at 7hwy and 40hwy in Blue Springs, MO, a suburb of Kansas City.  We saw three orb lights, in a triangle formation, float over the HyVee grocery store, turn while crossing 40hwy, and then float over the WalMart.  Then they suddenly zoomed off at incredibly high speed in the direction of my house.  The way they moved made us feel like they were attached.  Both of us saw the lights and were a bit freaked out.  That\\'s when things started to get really crazy.  As we continued down 40 hwy and the other two roads [road names REDACTED, since it\\'s near my parent! s house], nearly every single street light we passed by suddenly went out.  It was making us very scared, especially since we were in a convertible.  My friend pulled into the circle drive I lived on, and dropped me off at the bottom of the driveway.  Before getting out, I noted that it was 11:55pm, before curfew, since I was worried about getting back in time.  When I got inside, my dad half-joked that I was late (it wasn\\'t a serious violation) and I said \"What are you talking about?\"  I looked at the time and it was 12:05am.  I was so confused.  How did it take me 10 minutes to walk inside?  I went straight inside.  So I talked to my friend the next day and he told me something pretty interesting (and scary).  Apparently when he was at the stop sign to leave my circle drive, he saw a bright flash in his rear view mirror.  He turns around, and he said he couldn\\'t see me anywhere.  He then drove away quickly, which at the time ticked me off that he just left me like that.  ! That about freaked the hell out of me.  I\\'ve only told these stories to a few people, but figured that I might as well come forward now.  I bet there are a lot of normal people out there, like me, who would never google UFO reports and actually type up something like this and send it in because they would think that they must be crazy.  But I am starting to think that there is something to this whole UFO thing and that if I didn\\'t share this, then I wouldn\\'t be helping anyone figure out what\\'s going on.  I also got my accurate times for the first report from the messaging app on my iPhone.  I sent the text to my fiance right after the event (and I also sent her one right after I awoke to tornado sirens, she lived in the Kansas City area at the time) and it was logged in the app.  Honestly, I have no idea what\\'s going on, but its starting to freak me out a bit that stuff that I\\'ve seen is showing up on TV in the town I live in when I thought that there must be a rational explanation.  I just can\\'t get my mind aroun! d the idea that there are aliens flying around the earth.  It just doesn\\'t seem possible.  I just thought that was something to be scared of as a child, like monsters or the boogie man.  If it\\'s proven that aliens are real, then it\\'s going to be really hard for me to deal with that.  It just doesn\\'t make sense!  Why would they even appear like this or take people?  What is the motive?  Are they bored?  Why not just come down and show themselves?  Are they just having fun with us?  It is so weird that other people have seen something similar to what I saw.  It is even more weird that there have been enough people seeing things that a UFO tv show came to this town to interview people.  I wish they would go away because now I\\'m fearful of their presence and my possible connection to them.  Also my mom told me a couple years ago that my grandpa used to see ufos, strage lights, and would awake in the middle of the night, at the window, sleepwalking, talking to them outside the w! indow.  My mom saw a ufo with them when she was younger, hover! ing over a car in a parking lot late one night.  That was probably sometime in the late 70s early 80s.  Is there something about my family that attracts them?  Or is it a coincidence?  Sorry for the rambling, I\\'ve got a huge project due in the morning and it\\'s getting late!  Time to get back to work...feel free to edit this to make it more cohesive for online consumption.  Thanks for your time.',\n",
       "       'Seen Three aliens three different times outside my window within 2 weeks I saw three translucent inter-dimensional beings out my window three times in 2 weeks   I was sitting on my recliner in my living room.  I was watching my Television and I noticed something in the trees.  I looked through my big glass window that looks onto the back of the apartment building. I saw three aliens or some kind of beings in my trees.  At least I thought they were in the trees. The tree line is about 10 feet my window.  They were about 4  feet off the ground. I was scared to death, I could not move, I just froze with fear.  There were three of them. They were sitting side by side. At least I think they were sitting, hard to tell because they were translucent. I could see right through them, seeing the leaves move behind them.  Like in the movie “Predator” they were kind of see through but the outline of them was visible. They were on a platform.  They had very long arms and the width of their bodies were about 6.  Their height was maybe 1 foot, hard to tell since I was not sure if they were sitting or standing.  This was about 10.am around the first week of July, of 2009 in Milwaukee Wisconsin.  I am in an apartment complex that is two stories’ high and 10 apartments wide.  Mostly very nice Mexican people live here.  I am from Georgia.  I mention that in case this becomes significant since there are so many sightings of  UFO’s in Mexico. In no way were these Grays aliens that people talk about.  The face was cone shaped. I could not really make out eyes or any features.  Obviously they were cloaked or thought they were invisible, I do not know.  They stared at me the whole time, never looking around, just right at me for about 4 minutes.   Finally I got the nerve to stand up slowly and make my way to the front door. I knew the window was open; I wanted to close it because I was afraid they would come in and abduct me. Or do experiments as we hear about what happens to people.  As I had my back to them for only a second, I turned to look back but they had gone. I then went too quickly to my neighbor’s apartment. She asked me if I had seen a ghost. I said just something very weird. I would not tell her for being afraid of her thinking I was crazy. I was so afraid I told no body. Not even my boyfriend who was out of town for the next two weeks. I was there alone. I want to let you know. I am a 48 year old woman from Georgia. I do not do drugs, I do drink a beer here and there but I had not had any beer for about a week. I have never hallucinated or imagined anything in my whole life. I am not on any prescription drugs and have never been on them. I was really seeing this and wish I had never had. So when Mark came home from working in Canada I did not tell him even though I was still scared. A couple mornings after he was home he woke me to ask if I have ever seen anything weird out the back window.  I said yes, why are you asking me? He was scared, I could tell as he started to tell me that he saw three beings out the back window in the trees that he could see through. It was about 5:30 as we slept in the living room all night since it is cooler then than our bedroom. We have had placed our mattress on the floor near the front door. He said there were three of them side by side with cone faces, long arms and almost he could make out! eyes or holes where there would be eyes. He described them exactly as I had seen them and also they were on a platform. He said the platform was a milky color but still translucent. He could see the outline and see the leaves right through them. He said their heads were moving up and down, to the right to the left looking at the back of out apartment building. He was sure they did not see him since he was so far from the window near the front door on the mattress which is on the floor. When I am in my recliner I am only about 4 feet from the window. He said they were there for about 4 minutes also then they disappeared. When I asked him to point right where he saw them, it was interesting because they were on the right side of our window but when I saw them they were on the left side. Remember now both times were in the morning and same description. He said they were doing something with their hands, maybe working controls? I don’t know, I am just scared out of my mind the! y will come back again. I was happy I could share this bizarre! happeni ng in out lives. So about two days after Mark had seen them I was in my recliner watching Television. It was around 9 a.m in the morning. I saw movement in the trees again and this time there was only one of the beings. I saw him for about only about 1 minute or minute and a half or so. This time he was in the middle of the window about the same height in the trees. His cone shaped face and long hanging arms, looking right at me. I was very scared and had a look of fear on my face. Mark was in the room and when he saw my face he saw I was scared but when he turned his head to look it disappeared. Now I have been analyzing this highly unusual event. I am scared all time. I am in fear they will take mark or myself to where to do what? Why appear behind an old run down apartment building in virtually the same place area in the trees? This has reoccurred three times in the morning hours. From about a minute and a half to about 4 minutes they stay to study mark or I? To take readings of the Earth, say maybe they are measuring the Earths magnetic field, gasses in atmosphere? Are they planning an attack on mankind? Do they want to become our friends? Learn our language? Are they just as curious about us as we are of them? Do they want to reproduce with our species? Do they want to use us as food? So many things run through our heads, WHY WHY HERE? Why not appear at the White House, a museum, a school, a park or in a science laboratory? Why behind an old apartment building at OUR WINDOW? Are the other people in the apartments seeing them also? I am not ready to ask around. I want to move out of here as quickly as I can but for financial reasons I don’t see that happening anytime soon. Maybe they will never appear again and my nerves can calm down. \\tMy girlfriend Mary is vey excited about this. She wants to see them very badly so she can take photos or video tape them to show the world. She says this is very important for the world to see that beings are showing up here repeatedly. She says they probably are not from another world but from another dimension. That maybe their laboratory in their dimension is situated right there at all times but the veil from our dimensions are opening up. They are not really in the trees at all but in their time and a different dimension. They could be opening and closing them. They are showing up as almost invisible, is that because they are scared that we will shoot them? They know enough that this is a common reaction among humans, Shoot first ask questions later. Do they even know we see them at all? Mary says we can roll up a ball of yarn with a long string on the end. When they appear throw it at them, it might go into their place and we might see just a string hanging in mid air! when they closed the veil. The yarn will not show harmful intent because we could put a note on it saying :Become our friends, Talk to us, we know your there. We could put a little present inside the ball of yarn. She wants to bring in a high tech video camera, digital camera, regular camera, infrared camera, aura camera and a meter she has that can pick up very low frequencies that turns it into voice.

       "       'My wife, son and myself were going to Spokane Washington to look at some houses that we were going to buy during the first week of this Sept. 2009. We decided to drive all night because we have a disabled son that has a late schedule. Twenty miles out from Spokane on HWY 90 east around 4:30am we encountered several sparklers like things hovering over our car just off the right side of the windshield. I noticed that they were pacing our car as we drove. I felt like I was being hypnotized by the sparklers like objects. I noticed my wife and son staring at it and not saying a word about what was happening. I thought this was some kind of warning and felt very scared that something was going to happen to us. I was afraid to stop so I lowered my speed and shielded my eyes so I could not see them. By doing so I felt like I was not being affected by the attempt by them to hypnotized me. I was scared at this point and yelled out to my wife, \"Is it trying to hypnotiz! ed you, is it a warning of some kind.\" Cathy finally said something like \"I don\\'t know what do they want?\" I kept looking down at the time and it didn\\'t seem like it was changing even after a very long time and miles had past. I was thinking they wanted to hurt us or do something to the road ahead to hurt us. Each time I took my hand down from shielding my eyes I felt again they were trying to hypnotize me, like I was blacking out and not in control. I remember cars and trucks passing in the other direction and honking there horns at us as if they were seeing these things over our car. We begin praying and saying the lords prayer, it seem as if I could not think as if my mind went blank and I could not remember even what was happening to us and even what these things looked like. I had to put a memory into my head what they looked like or I think I wouldn\\'t remember what they looked like. I remember saying to Cathy they look like giant sparklers at the same time she said it! . I thought they had gone away but they must have just moved a! way for a short time because I noticed they were back and I remember saying to Cathy no they are still here, don\\'t look at them. She noticed my speed had dropped to 40 miles an hour in a 70 miles an hour zone and she told me to speed up or we were going to be hit from behind. Soon after that they left. I think that they tried to abduct us but were not able to because of the medication I take for depression. (Zoloft) I feel if I had not taken this medication that night we would of for sure been abducted by these strange devices that hovered over our car for such a long time that night.  500 Lights On Object0: Yes',\n",
       "       'white beam of light and cylindrical object   I want to report an incident that occurred when I was about 6 years old, which would have been approximately 1964.  I have never forgotten it. I was a small child living with my great grandmother in a small town in Oklahoma, very small town. I guess it had a population then of less than 2,000. Lindsay, Oklahoma is where I was born and raised and where the following events occurred. I stayed with her a lot. My mother lived nearby and had 4 other children younger than me. I was very close with my great grandmother and was her favorite. Because I had no way of describing what happened at the time I recounted the events to my great grandmother the next morning over breakfast as that I had been lifted in the air last night by a white light to what my mind at the time thought was a giant silver tube of toothpaste. (the shape was the only thing I could come up with that my little mind could describe). I tried to describe how scary it was. I don’t remember any discussion about it again. It wasn’t until I was an adult and something caused me to think of it again that I realized what had happened was an UFO abduction. I will describe exactly what I remember. I was in bed with my great grandmother which is where I always slept. I awoke to find myself floating up in the air inside a white beam of light. I was outside because I looked down to see my great grandmother’s house below me. I recall being terrified to the nth degree. I can’t even begin to explain how scared I was. I looked up to see that I was being drawn through the air to a very large, cylindrical shiny silver object with a dark opening in it…to which I was being lifted towards. It seemed that a being was standing near the opening and watching me floating up to it. I have absolutely no recollection of what occurred inside the UFO. I woke up again back inside my great grandmother’s house. A disturbing thing to me now which at the time I didn’t relate properly and couldn’t explain properly is that the day of my return I complained to my mother and great grandmother that my genital area was very sore. I complained enough that they examined the area to see if something was wrong. I was questioned as to what made me so sore and I know this sounds weird but because I was a small child and had no remembrance of being inside the UFO and anything that could have happened all that my mind could come up with was that a blade of grass had been inserted into me. They were perplexed and asked me repeatedly what had happened and I gave the same explanation again. It’s all that I knew to say….for some reason I believed that something had been inserted and knew that it was something similar to a blade of grass. I had no idea how the blade of grass came to enter me. It’s all I knew to say. I am 50 years old now and still remember these events vividly. I believe that it was an UFO abduction. When I became an adult and began to read and learn of other abductions I realized that I had experienced this too. As a child I couldn’t explain it because I had never heard of UFOs  and had no vocabulary or knowledge to explain it. I have related the experience a couple of times to family members but they think I must have dreamed it. I can understand that because it sounds so weird that I don’t want to believe it either. I just wanted to tell my story to someone and have it documented. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))',\n",
       "       'Three incidents that happened to me in the White Mountains. My friend and I were hiking to Tuckerman\\'s Ravine on Mt. Washington late at night in 1967. We were both 17 and still in High School.   I decided to rest on a very large rock and drink some wine. We were laying on our backs looking up at the stars when my friend said, \"look at that star moving across the sky\".  I  said, \"That must be the satellite echo, the one covered with a reflective surface.\"  Then my friend started stuttering which was a complete surprise to me.  He said \"Tha tha that\\'s no satellite, it\\'s reading my mind.  Then I connected also and it flashed a great big \"Hello\" like in lights in my brain, and then it shot off toward the moon and disappeared into a speck and then gone.  It\\'s possible that we were abducted because I can\\'t remember anything about the trip after that except driving home.   There are two more incidents connected to this.  One happened 7 years earlier in 1960 when I was 10 years old.  This time my family was with me, my father, brother and mother. Hiking from the top of Mt. Washington to Mt. Adams, I became very ill and had a 104 degree temperature. When we finally made it to the Mt. Adams hut, I was burning up. My mother asked everyone at the hut if they were a doctor. One couple told her, \"We are not doctors, but we can heal your son\". She said \"OK\" and brought them to me in the mens dorm. They explained to her what they were going to do. \"We are going to put our hands on your son\\'s chest and remove the fever.\" The woman put her hands on my chest and the man put his hands on her elbows. Immediately they started to withdraw from the burning heat that drained out of my chest. The man said to the women, \"Did you burn your fingers?\" She said \"yes\" and I could see her fingers were bright red. I felt completely better immediately. My mother took my temperature and it was back to 98.6. My mother will vouch that all this happened. My brother and father didn\\'t see it and didn\\'t believe it. We learned later that this couple belonged to the Atherious Society. The next incide! nt happe ned seven years after the second incident, which was listed first. , when I was 24. Again, I was hiking to the Mt. Adams hut, this time with my 17 year old cousin. We wanted to go to the top of Mt. Adams first, but there was a large man completely covered in rain gear and all you could see were his eyeballs. He was standing at the base of the trail to the top and he roughly told us we couldn\\'t hike up there because of the bad weather. It was windy, but it wasn\\'t very cold and it was a bright sunny day. I could see a lot of people coming down from the top. We were a little annoyed but decided to take his advice and take the short cut to the Mt. Adams hut. When we were about 50 feet away, something lifted us up in the air about 4 feet and layed us on the ground gently on our backs. I looked back, but the man was gone. I was sure he had done this to us.  Again, I don\\'t remember discussing this at the time and ever again with my cousin. A few years later, I wrote to Betty Hill after Barney had died. I told her about these incidents and I got a wonderful letter back from her. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))',\n",
       "       \"Events throughout my life   I am not wanting this to be shown.. I have written several times . Many of my reports do not have accurate dates. I have had several things happen.  Anyway.. I have a question that I am hoping someone will have an answer to.   When I was in 6th grade , approx 11 years old, my family and I witnessed an exstreamly large craft go from the west to the east side of town and directly over our home. It started out looking like a brilliant , bright  white light traveling very slowly from the west phoenix area. We were alerted to it by my brother who was on his way home with his father who lived in Scottsdale. He noticed it while on the freeway and was very concerned to see it still in the sky when he arrived to our home which was at Gaudalupe and Dobson rd. My whole family- Mother ,grandparents , step father and one of my brothers friends- all went outside to see what he was so upset about. We observed this  object coming closer to us . It was , no joke, about the size of a football field. It didn't have lights on it like it looked from far away. As it got closer we could see it was illuminating from within. It made no noise, just a low kind of warm humming sound. Not like a blimp. It was flying  low and it was  exstreamly large. I would say if you were to hold your hand out you would have to put two fingers together to cover it. My step father worked at air research at the time and even he was puzzled as to what it was. It was not a blimp, plan, or helicopter. It looked like it had windows completely around it, or possibly metal  panels and if I remember right it almost (im not trying to make a joke) but it kinda looked like the starship enterprise. Only in the sense that It seemed to have two sections to it. It was moving super slow .When it reached the end of our block it swayed a bit and you could see it was wider that our street. It then sped up and took of ,very fast north east and was gone. Absolutely gone. The next day I said something to my teacher.. He got very excited and made me go to the principles office and draw a picture for the principle. They both questioned me.. My teacher had seen it also and was using me to try to help prove his story.. It was very outrageous and I am sure very unbelievable if you hadent seen this for yourself.. I am getting to my question.. please be patient.  .. Now when I was sixteen, living in the same home, I had a very unexplainable event. I was coming home from my best friend house .. She lived 2 miles from me. I left at exactly 8:50PM .. I know because we use to watch the Waltanns religiously- of all shows!! anyway,  the show ended at 9pm. I was also due in at 9 , if I was late I would be grounded.. At sixteen that is the worst thing in the world to have happen.. My parents were strict and I was never late. So I pulled in front of the house , shut off my VW bug and then I was surrounded by the most intense blue-white light. My car kinda rumbled .. Its very hard to explain. I at the time thought I had been hit by lightning,I could feel the energy. Thats what I attributed it to at that second,  without realizing it was a totally clear night. The color of the light was  not a color I can explain.  It was blueish white. It consumed me and the whole car. Then it was over and I jumped out of the car and ran in. I was greeted with two VERY upset parents. I was an hour late. I had completely forgot what had just happened.. Even when trying to defend myself. I had no excuse and was very confused.. All I know is I left at 8:50 and walked in at 10pm.  I called my friend sobbing, screaming at her for making me late.. She defended the fact of when I left and said I was crazy. I was traumatized because I was not allowed to see my boyfriend for a week, or talk on the phone.. I didnt recall the light thing for about 3 to four years later. To this day my friend remembers the event.. We are still very good friends.. We still cant explain why i was late or what happened.. I am writing wondering if anyone has had a similar event.. If anyone has seen something then while at the same location they have a loss of time or some other unusual event.. Is it possible that the first time we saw the craft it was the first of several visits? I am not making much sense.. I guess I am wondering -if it is possible that abductions occur, do you think they make a planned route that they trav! el?.. Do they scope out , or survey areas and people  first?  I am confused and still want to understand what happened.. I have had 2 other events in my life where I have had the same light consume me. It is an unforgettable color I have never seen duplicated, even in the movies.  Only one of the other  times  I have  a witness to my time loss. Again, at the time you forget what has just happened, and are left just completely confused. .  All the times I remember seeing the light , but never seem to be able to comprehend it or associate with what is or has happened. I am not a very good writer, I hope this makes sense to someone.. I really hope I can get some kind of understanding of this.. Is there any other people in Az that something like this has happened to them? One thing I did not mention.. The friend of my  brothers who witnessed the ship with my family the first time, he still to this day will not talk about it.. He will admit he saw it, but CAN  not elaborate. I tried to talk with him about 6 years ago and he gets all sweaty and freaked out.. He actually almost crys.. He cant talk about it for some reason.. Im wondering if  possibly something happened to him and he remembers it too much.. Or is it possible he had bad things done to him, or ma bey his mind cant comprehend something that happened to him that night? I am hoping someone can give me some kind of answer or insight... ..

       "       \"Cerritos/Artesia 1980 silent black disc with firey rim observed at dusk I was riding in the backseat of a friend’s vehicle (2 in front, 3 in the rear) traveling north on Pioneer Blvd, specifically to go to McDonald’s. We turned west onto the small street on the south side of the McDonald’s. I recall, very vividly, the object was  a matte black disc with small orange ‘flames’ around its edge, coming from the west, from say Lakewood or Long Beach (one would expect to see the Lakewood Sheriff station’s helicopter on a similar path) with silence. It was around late dusk and I recall remembering the event later and the fact that we seemed to have returned to my friend’s home minus any McDonald's food, no need to discuss the object, and hearing about John Lennon’s murder that evening , which helped me date the event. I make no abduction claims at all, just the sighting, but feel a distinct loss of time from the moment the object was passing over and being back in the TV den at my friend’s house. The street and parking lot, hence the restaurant, was busy when the sighting occurred.\",\n",
       "       'lights that appear to be stars, blending in with the night stars I recently heard your program on coast to coast, 2-16-09, I would like to briefly give you some back ground information of where I live, I was born and raised in west central Wyoming at the foot of the wind river mountains, putting me on the east side of the rocky mountains in WY very sparsely populated. I personally believe that \"whatever\" or \"whoever\" is controlling these \"objects\", \"lights\" I have seen most of these at night and two shiny objects in the day time, that glimmered for a few seconds and disappeared. That they can operate in relative anonymity because of the back drop of the mountains coupled with no population towards the west and into the rocky mountains until you reach the very western portion of WY and encounter sparse populations again. \\tI have never written or reported what I am about to describe as my experiences, I have only talked about this with close friends or family members, some of them have seen what I have seen. I am compelled to write about these experiences, for some of them I have never heard or read about anywhere, but may have been reported to this site. In the mid 1970\\'s, when I was around 13 yrs old, I was walking home from a friends house at night after sunset, getting dark. I was startled to see about a mile away a bright white light, that did not light up the surrounding area and had the luminosity of that of a star, rise and fall behind a hill in a circular motion, this happened in a couple of seconds. I was in shock when I got home and wondered about what I had seen for days (it was at this point I became open minded about reading of UFO sightings and all the strange stories that came with UFO sightings, abductions, contacts. etc...). When I was around 17, I was coming home from work, traveling in westerly direction towards home about a mile away (my home is at 6,200 ft, foothills, traveling up the switch backs for another ½  mile you can be at 12,000 ft ), it was getting dark, something was just not right for a few seconds in the sky when I noticed that a star was bigger than any star should be was in the sky, if it was not for its size I probably would not have noticed. This star slowly fell from the sky and into a canyon, the walls on the canyon were turning different colors red, green, blue as this light fell into the canyon. For weeks and months I scanned the skies to see if I could see anything similar I became aware of the stars, planets, planes and satellites and always kept glancing at the night sky to see anything out of the ordinary I seen none. In my late 30\\'s I was at my parents home, in the living room watching TV, the TV was in the corner and next to the TV was a large picture window that faced in an easterly direction. I seen what appeared to be a shooting star that fell from a north to south direction. It streaked across the sky, burned out. But then reappeared and was bobbing up and down in the air and slowly stopped, it then moved slowly across the hills in a southerly direction and was turning different colors of red, green and blue, until it disappeared from sight about 15 to 20 seconds and about 100 to 200 feet above the ground. Also around this same time (months) I was walking my infant son back and forth in my trailer and when passing a small window I seen a bright white light (star) that was traveling horizontally in a westerly direction towards the mountains, before it reached the mountains it went out. The next day and this was in the middle of July the face of the mountain in a circular pattern looked like it was covered in light snow in the area of where I seen the light. My mother had seen this as she was washing dishes, we planned to go to the side of the mountain to see what this was, but it rained within a couple of hours and this light white snow looking stuff was gone, this was about 10 am in the morning. My wife, older son, brother in law and nephews all seen this and could only wonder what it was. Another strange deal is what I have thought to be satellites. In the early 90\\'s I, my wife, nephew and cousin were lighting fire works I had a flashlight to see the fuses when they were lit. I noticed what appeared to be a satellite that was moving through the sky and told everyone look there is a satellite moving in the sky. My wife said where, I pointed with the flashlight \"on\", at the satellite. My wife seen it moving along with my nephew right as I pointed the light at it and we all seen it stop and remain motionless and became a fixture as part of the stars. Needless to say I have had the same experiences on a couple of other occasions with these so called satellites that stop in the sky once they are noticed (weird).

       "       'I was abducted and I lost time. I was home and babysitting my two nephews. They were sleeping in the family livingroom.Well, I was up late this night. I was looking out the window facing our back yard. All the sudden, I see this beam flashing on and off over houses and trees. I was really afraid. But,I just watch as these lights flash on and off. It was as if they were searching lights. In a moment notice the light was over my house. It was than, I felt something touch my sides of my waist. The next thing, I woke up sitting upright on my couch the next morning. I dont remember walking over to the couch and I dont have any memory of the rest of the night. Plus I would never in a million years sleep that way. I was shock to see myself in this position it was almost like I was place there. In my heart, I know that I was abducted by a UFO. This is hard because unless it happen to you. It is hard for anyoe to beleive me. I know out in the world there are other like me who have lost time.

       "       'I threw rocks at a UFO for about a half an hour What accrued happened in Danbury Connecticut on Newtown Rd. It was very dark area with only a couple of city light poles that were on. There were a couple of stores in that area but they were all closed. There are a lot of hills in this area so it further darkens the area. I was about eighteen years old at the time. My friend and I were working at a Burger King until about 10 pm. We went outside to wait for a ride and we were talking. We went across the street where there was a pay phone that I was going to use to call to see where our ride was and I noticed that where we just walked from was a seeming to be round object just hovering in the air about 30 feet not very high no real noise except for humming. I felt and heard a humming just like an electrical sub station, there’s ones in every town. I felt my hairs standing up. The object was about the size of the Burger King, just a little wider. There were about eight, two foot wide bulbs around the round object. My friend and I walked under it at an angle and tried to make out the shape with the stars since it was the only light above, there was no moon and the stars were almost not visible. We first thought it was a hot air balloon with lights on the bottom but with the little stars that were out, we couldn’t see how high it exactly was, but we knew it wasn’t high like a balloon. I need to say this, over the years I’ve read a lot about of what other people have written about what they saw, and what’s different about mine, is that I think my friend and I are the only dumb asses that threw rocks and tar from the road at it for about a good half an hour. And we didn’t even hear the rocks fall back on the ground and we didn’t hear it hit the object. After about half an hour of throwing rocks at it we watched it slowly rise up then whoosh, it went up fast, in like a couple of seconds it shot up, we saw the lights get closer together, get smaller, and dim, in a matter of two to three seconds. My take on why it left so abruptly, is that I think they were going to abduct us until they found out they’d have serious problems with the two dumb asses that were throwing rocks at them. Just kidding. One more thing, there is one more witness, this was a little strange, it was my ride which happened to be my mom. She didn’t see it there, but at her job which happens to be on the other side of the hill / small mountain, at the Davis and Geck parking lot. We talked about it a few days after it happened, because we ended up walking home. She said she was afraid of it and went back inside to get someone to walk her back to he car. It happened at night, and that is all I know. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))',\n",
       "       'Driving to Galveston @ 10 p.m. Nov. of `81, I saw 100s of saucers, got out of car and pointed upwards but 3 other cars wouldn\\'t stop. I know someone in one of the other three cars driving behind me on that deserted highway that October or November night between 10 and 11 p.m. in either 1980 or 1981 would remember me getting out of my 1969 yellow Toyota Corolla and pointing up to the spacecrafts, if they were one of the people in one of the other cars that were driving behind me. I am 6\\'5\" and at that time I weighed about 185 pounds, with 70s-style brown hair so I know I must have looked really skinny then. I was heading south on Highway 288, I believe, but as I said, I was lost so it could have been on another south bound deserted stretch of freeway on my way to where I lived in Lake Jackson, Texas. There were three other cars driving behind me when I came upon the sighting and this is what I saw:  I saw hundreds of sphere or saucer-shaped spacecraft soundlessly landing and taking off in the vacant field or pasture along the freeway. There could easily have been 1,000 of these flying saucers. They had lights in the middle bottom part of them and this \"light\" is what seemed to propel the crafts. They landed three-at-a-time and the moment they landed, three others would launch. They seemed to hover momentarily, then in a beam of light, they would be gone, straight up and out of sight. With the other cars traveling behind me, I knew that I was not the only one who had witnessed this hard to believe sight so I pulled to the shoulder of the highway, exited my car and began walking toward the oncoming cars. I waved and pointed upwards in hopes that someone might have a camera to document the incident. It surprised me when the driver of the first vehicle accelerated and kept going. Soon the second and third vehicle basically did the same thing, leaving me there alone. At that point, one of the smaller saucer-shaped spacecrafts traveled directly toward me, stopping almost overhead, hovering without sound above me. If I could have picked up a rock and thrown it, I know that I could have hit it but it never crossed my mind at the time. There was a noticeably lit dome on the top of the craft which was opaque so I couldn\\'t see into it. I had the distinct feeling that I was being confronted and fear overcame me. I ran to my car, jumped into the driver\\'s seat and with seconds feeling like an eternity, I turned the key. The engine strained and I thought I was doomed but soon, miraculously my car started. I threw the car into gear, floored it and never looked back, however, it seemed to me that I drove away in extra slow motion as the car strained but seemed to continuously pick up speed. It was still dark when I sped away however, looking back on it all now, it seems that I somehow lost several hours. I remember arriving home around daylight the next morning and my wife accused me of being out all night, drinking with the guys. I remember that she had said I was \"a day late,\" but at that time I just shrugged it off and was just so relieved to be home. In 2005 I was diagnosed with an AVM in the left lobe of my brain. I have never considered that I could have been \"abducted\" that night, but I know without a shadow of a doubt that I actually saw what I saw. I am positive the other people in the cars behind me saw the incident as well, however they did not stop as I had expected they would. It upset me that nobody stopped to talk about it with me, but now I realize that they were probably just extremely scared, exactly as I was the moment I realized I was alone. I haven\\'t talked about this incident to too many people. I probably wouldn\\'t believe the story, myself, had I not experienced it first hand. I have often thought about that incident and have wondered who the people in those other three cars could have been so I Googled `UFO sighting in Texas City/Galveston in October/November, 1981. Anyone remember this?\\' and I saw the story of the guy who said he could see in his peripheral vision that the other driver was pointing upwards. The question I have for that reportee, is, \"Was this other driver a tall, skinny guy standing outside of a yellow 1969 Toyota Corolla?\" If the answer is yes, then my question is, `Hey buddy, why didn\\'t you stop? Do you know I could have been killed, or worse yet, abducted?\\'  The people in those three cars probably thought I was crazy, but I honestly thought they\\'d stop, otherwise I would have probably never gotten out of my car. If I would have known they were going to leave me standing there, I would have stayed in the car, too, then floored it and left, but being the social type . . .. I have to say that as I stood on that dark, deserted freeway late that night, that was one time that I wished I hadn\\'t been as tall as I am. My current wife said that in about 1973 or 1974, after a Friday night visit in the wee hours of the next morning, she and her family were walking some (visiting Channelview, Texas) neighbors out to their car in Sheldon Woods, north east of Houston, Texas. She said that as a group, four grown adults, a 13-year-old boy (my wife\\'s brother) a 12-year-old girl (my wife) and a 9-year-old girl (my wife\\'s little sister) witnessed, slowly traveling north over the housetops of the houses in that neighborhood, a huge, though silent, 400 to 500 feet-long rectangle-shaped spacecraft with lights all over it that seemed to be actively surveying the quiet neighborhood. Although as a group, they all just stood and stared up at the hard to describe spacecraft, my wife, her little sister and her parents remember the incident but her brother and the other two adults profess that they don\\'t remember the incident. In fact, they never discussed it until recently. My wife joked that her big brother and the two visiting adults must have been abducted therefore they probably don\\'t remember. She is kidding, of course, but entertaining the thought that I could have been abducted that night in October or November of 1981 (and it could have been 1980) is actually not an entertaining thought. I\\'d be interested in reading what others may have to say about what the chances are that I could have actually been \"abducted,” and if AVMs are associated with this type of scenario. I will say that at times I have had an extremely difficult life with more than a normal person\\'s share of trials and tribulations. I have always said that most of the difficulty I\\'ve experienced has been from the unwise decisions I\\'ve made, so it would be comforting to learn that it was never me, but the ALIENS, all along. Seriously, despite the health problems and other difficulties I\\'ve had, I\\'ve now got my life headed in a direction that I\\'m content with. After making two incompatible choices for marriage partners, I was blessed with six beautiful children so I am thankful for these women for that. I finally married my high school sweetheart, (who has six children of her own, making it a dozen for us altogether.) She happens to be a professional writer and helped me put this hard-to-believe actual U.F.O. sighting into a flowing, readable story so I truly thank her for that. If you were one of the people in one of the three cars behind me, then it would be great to have someone validate my story, and if you feel like I have felt all these years, have me validate your story, too. Most people report seeing one strange U.F.O. or experience, I\\'ve never heard of anyone else ever seeing this many U.F.O.\\'s in one sighting.

       "       \"I may have been abducted with the time differential but have no recollection of missing time. It was a beautiful early morning ( 6 am.)a friend and I went fishing at Harvey 's Lake a 25 minute drive from home. So we went to a a big rock across from Hanson's Park ( you can see the old ricketty rollercoaster ) around a quarter mile across.  There is a patch of hill than a stone patio next to a dock we have permission to fish from.  We decided to setup on the patio.  As we fished you could see the street light across the way by the park.  So we fished and some time later around a hour or two I noticed that the light didn't go out and seemed a little closer.  I thought nothing of it and fished some more.  Then I noticed it closer than BAM.......... I looked up in the sky and saw a Black object hoovering oh so slow above us moving toward our backside and were only 100 yards above the 60 foot treetops.  It looked like no UFOs I saw in books and other source before.  The shape was like a small triangle in front with another bigger triangle combined together. I have a attachment drawing it was all black.  As I ran to the road that circumferences the lake the craft went slowly out of sight, moving along the mountains behind the lake.  When I ran back tomy friend and  he looked bewildered ,  I said;  hey man did you see that and he just keep fishing with a sort of nod. At this I asked my friend  what time it was he said 10:30 am.. A hour or two disappeared !!  It sort of freaked me out and excited me at the same time.  Again my friend would not talked about the incident and that was that. I have never forgot this incident and have had 3 more experinces.  They earlier in time 2 around 30 years ago and one in the early ninties.

       "       'Spherical UFO tracks vehicle This event took place in the year 1993. It’s been 15 years since it occurred so I don’t remember the exact date, but, it was during the spring. I am from Pharr, Texas which is a border town in the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. When I was in high school I played in a rock-n-roll band. On occasion we would take trips up to Austin and San Antonio to watch rock bands or just sight-see. Our typical route took Highway 281 up north.  On this day we had completed about two-thirds of the trip. We had passed the town of Three Rivers and were about one-third the way from Three Rivers to San Antonio. Back then this tract of road was mostly woods with some ranches and other buildings sparsely populating the land. I turned to look outside my window for no reason; I being on the passenger end of the car. I looked out above the tree line and there, clear as day, was the UFO. The UFO was a perfect sphere, its surface appeared something liked polished aluminum and its diameter was approximately between 7-8 ft. At first I thought it might be a smudge or glare on the window because it appeared to be tracking our car perfectly, absolutely matching our speed perfectly. I adjusted my view several times to see if the image was on the window or whether it really was outside. The UFO was indeed real and flying above the tree line, apparently, tracking us. At this point, I have to admit, the realization that this thing was tracking us frightened me a bit. It’s very difficult to explain the emotions aroused by this kind of occurrence. It was quite alarming. I continued to watch this UFO for many minutes (at least 10 minutes) and then it suddenly occurred to me to tell my friend driving the car. I had been so caught up in the event I had completely ignored him. When I turned to tell him I realized he was already looking at it. He later told me that, after noticing my behavior, he had placed the car in cruise control and was switching between watching the road and watching the UFO. As I turned to once again look at the UFO it had disappeared. Amazingly we were quiet for quite a few minutes before we began talking about. My friend, in particular was quite distressed about the event. We never spoke about it again and I have only told a handful of people about it since. Incidentally, a few years later, another UFO, this one a very large cigar shaped UFO was spotted, not very high in the sky, above my house by some relatives who are also neighbors. They ran to my house to tell me, they were almost to hysterics, but by the time we went outside the UFO had disappeared. Many UFOs were seen throughout the Rio Grande Valley that year. The local news referred to it as a UFO flap. That was the first time I heard that term. I have always wondered if the fact that two UFOs were seen around me was just coincidence or not. I have not been abducted or anything of the sort, in fact I don’t believe alien abductions actually occur, but I have to admit, a bit embarrassingly, that, ever so often , I look up to the sky, a little afraid, wondering if anything up there is watching me.

       "       'Possible humanoid being sighting/abduction attempt?? ((NUFORC Note:  We are uncertain as to whether this is intended as a serious report.  PD)) I recently stumbled upon your website and decided it time to report one of dozens of sightings in my life. I have witnessed dozens of flying objects as a keen sky observer and budding amateur astrologist.. but can\\'t verify any of them as i always seem to be isolated and alone when it happens and many are most likely space junk causing \"shooting star\" like objects to fly across the night sky. I\\'ve seen dozens of those now. I once reported to the Australian police a sighting of a perfectly round object hovering above my top floor apartment which appeared to be at least 5 miles wide.. this was ignored.. and I myself quickly wrote it off as just light refractions. My report here however is not of a UFO but of a being. I had walked out of my home late at night as i was studying.. it was approximately 1999.. so i cannot recall the exact date. The night was still and silent with no wind. I walked outside my back yard.. and spotted a white figure.. i estimate it to have been 4 feet tall.. and was all white with a subtle glow. I stood in frozen shock as we faced each other off for approximately 3 minutes. We stood only 5 meters apart so I could make out the shape but could not discern a face nor shoes.. it was completely white. In that time the object sat on top of my fence at the rear of my backyard which fell into parkland behind it, and made no effort to run away.. It did not move for the whole time, even as i approached- i got spooked when i was 5 meters away though and stopped purely because this figure did not seem worried by me approaching it.. we faced off for the next 3 long minutes.. and then eventually it slipped over the fence and disappeared. As it slipped away.. it did not make a single sound.. and nor did it make a sound as it left.. The object did not move and as i stood frozen i simply stared at it, thinking it was a burgular. strangely though.. the figure simply disappeared after a few minutes. it did not make a single sound as it did. A burgular hopping off a fence would have made some noise.. and in the dead of night i would have at least heard leaves crunching underfoot.. but in this case there was not a single sound. it simply vanished. the fact it was all white left me to this day with the eery feeling that what i experienced that day was not a burgular but a potential visitor from another world. I could not see any discernable features other than it was a human type shape.. i did not see arms or legs though.. roughly 4 feet tall.. it seemed to be shaped like a round blob sitting on my fence.. and then like a jelly blob.. it flopped over the fence and disappeared.. it did not make a single noise in doing so and i did not hear a single noise thereafter. This story is not provable and more for your information than for public publishing.. the area where this happened could even be tested as the fence upon which the figure appeared has not been changed since.. it could have been a potential burgular that night.. but if it was, then it was one highly skilled dude.. because not only was it terribly out of shape and unatheltic looking (it was shaped like Jabba the hut from Star Wars fame) but it managed to completely disappear without making a single sound in the dead of night.. and it seemed to just roll off the back fence..which is 8 feet tall..  also.. if it was a burgular why would it be wearing only white clothing.. they usually wear black.. to this day.. the thought of that night sends a chill up my spine.. so i thought i would report it for documentation on your database.. this happened in a suburb called Ashbury in Sydney\\'s inner city area ( the park is called Wagner Oval) .. a highly populated area but my home backs onto a large park which is where the figure disappeared into. it was also approximately 3am and no one else was on the streets at the time and the park was silent. my study is at the rear of my house overlooking my yard.. and my lights were always left on throughout the night as i studied for many years.. perhaps that attracted this figure.. a burgular again would have been deterred given that i was active till late all night.. this figure seemed to be sitting there just watching me.. until i noticed it, stared it off from a distance of only 5 meters.. it did not flinch nor seem worried either. it sat there the entire time before disappearing.',\n",
       "       \"Me and two other witnesses seen 3 lights in the sky on a evning walk. It was at night and me my grilfriend and her mom were walking on a little dirt trail to el zapatero north of our little village.  As we walked we noticed that over a hill top were 3 lithgs that stayed still over the mountain perhaps 100 feet in the air.  It was very dark and no lights were around us, the only light that lit the night was the stars and the moon. Then both lights moved up a little and kind of liked hubbured up I thought they could have been planes or helicopters but bot in that region because it was very forest like and no real civilization or evolution coud have hit it.  The weardest thing was when a third object came out of nowhere and aproched them its as if it was there leader because they then all hubbured left fast perhaps 300 feets spread apart evenly.  after maybe 1 minuete all at the same time flu upward into the sky like a rocket but faster in 2 seconds then disapeared into the heavens.  What was weard also is that the mom of the girl said she felt that she knew who they were and that she had seen lights like that before in the past but always thought nothing if it until know that made such a fuss about it.  That just made me think that she may have been abducted in the past, and even the possability that they may have had wiped any other memorys besides the seeing of the light.  But could that be possible and also returning her there at the same time.  I didn't share it with the two but me and my sister when we were little kids also seen five lights with strange movments and forming a strange patter in the skys over the delano california skys.

       "       'Missing Time July 31, 1997  It happened on July 31, 1997  I had seen something a few days earlier when I was in the backyard and called mom and told her about it, sometime the next morning several others saw the same UFO I did but they made a official report and were talking about it on Art Bell and it made the papers.. I had seen the UFO heading south toward California and it was seen by the others over Medford near the California border, later that same morning. After this sighting when I heard others talking about it on the radio and read about it in the paper, I decided to call Peter Davenport,at the National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle, Peter had been up most all night taking reports with all the sightings in Medford and was very tired and did not have time to take the report, or at least this is what I believe that he said.  I took it personally and thought I would never call Peter again (not Peters’ fault, just my own judgment of the situation. I was helping out a friend in a small store here and told her about it and was still smarting at how Peter had treated me, or I thought he had treated me, and told her about that too. Anyway I was home watching TV, my husband was about to go to bed, he is needs lots of sleep.. he reminded me to lock the back door and put the stick in it.. that way if the cats get ancy we can open the patio door, put a stick in it and let them go in and out at will... anyway I said I would, and did, and he went to bed and I lay down on the couch and was out like a light, fully dressed/shoes too The next thing I remember was waking up and seeing it was time to feed the cats, it was about 7AM.. my husband was in his computer room and the back door was open, the stick had been removed, I got up, fed cats and my husband and was relaxing watching TV news with my second cup of coffee, when the phone rang and it was <former boss>, she was calling me to see if I was alright, and to ask me about the lights, I said you mean the ones I saw the other night? She said NO the ones you saw this morning.. I said I did not see any lights this morning and she said Yes you did, she again said are you OK?   I said YES I was fine, why wouldn\\'t I be.. she said after your call this morning about the lights, I said what call, she said the one you made to me early this morning, she said you left me a message.. I wanted to hear it but she had erased it not thinking about it, but had listened to the message numerous times and had written it down verbatim\\' and signed the paper.. this is what she said the message said... (my remarks)  <name>, this is CK, I\\'m really sorry to call you at this time, it is 2:40 AM, in the morning, I am out by North Salem High School ( this is about 3 miles from my home) and I have been watching a bright light in the sky for about 45 minutes. If you know Peter Davenports number or one who does that sort of thing down here (In Salem) they need to be called. I am looking south and a little east and the large light is very bright, too big to be a star. There are 3 smaller lights in a line down one side and I can see two in a line down the other side, but there may be a third one, I can\\'t see from here. It hasn\\'t moved. If you know who investigates these please call them and tell them the information because there is no way this is stars.. End of recording/message.. I told <name> that she was kidding, right? she said \"No I swear its true\"  I asked her where I called from, she said she did not know, but that when I was done I did not say goodbye or anything, the line just went totally blank/dead, and it had a empty tinny sound. I called my husband into the living room and asked him when he took the stick out of the patio door? He said I thought you did, the door was open when I got up about 6:00 AM.. I ran to the front door, and it was closed but unlocked, it had been locked and a separate latch used, that was also open.. then I went into the driveway, scared of what I would find, and there was my car, parked on the opposite side of the driveway than I usually park.. I was terrified.. Where had I been, what had I done?  I asked my husband did you get up to go to the bathroom last night? He is usually up 2-3 times a night, NO he said for some reason he had not awakened till just before he got up.. I grabbed my purse and drove over to the high school, I got out of the car near the football field and walked over to the fence surrounding the field, trying to remember what I might have seen, did anything trigger a memory, and all that happened was that I got very dizzy, but walked around looking for some clue as to what had happened.. I remember looking for a tan shingled roof I had been standing near and wanted to check that out on the letter from <name>and was very surprised to see she/I had not mentioned any such roof or color of shingles in the message so it must have been a memory of the event..the only one I have had of that night. I am fortunate to know a lot of UFO researchers and I immediately called my old friend Dr Leo Sprinkle who works with abductees, some researchers or psychologists make the event scary, but if Dr Sprinkle does the same interview the abduction becomes a positive experience not a negative one, a learning experience. I was terrified about what could have happened... what if I would have had a car accident? a flat tire? How would I explain being out driving alone at 2:40 AM?   Dr Sprinkle pointed out that I was likely totally alert and in control till I got home and that is when they took remove any  memory of what happened.. This still haunts me and I still check the doors several times during the evening hours to be sure they are locked. For over a year I had slept fully dressed in a sweat suit complete with shoes etc. Note: Peter is always open and willing to listen to urgent reports. I just took his being tired personally and that was my problem, not Peters’ short coming.  CK 7/31/97',\n",
       "       'Two greys spotted near caddo river (perhaps doing ground survey?)   My wife and I were floating the caddo River in a canoe. Approximately one mile down from the dam. I observed two Greys standing in a clearing in the woods. One was facing away from me (West). The other Facing North. They were hudled together as if looking at something one of them were holding in hand. They were approximately 5\\'6\" tall. They were a pastey light greyish white with a yellow hue to their skin. They were not wearing clothing of any kind. When I saw them I decided not to investigate as this is usually what gets people abducted. My wife asked me what I was looking at and why I looked so shocked. I didnt tell her anything. She is a loud mouth and would have drawn attention to us if Id let her see them. The greys had Very large heads. They had a crease that ran from the forhead all the way back down to the back of the neck. Like two lobes. They were frail and I could see their  \" Spinal column\" and ribs. The weather was clear and sunny. Excelent visability. It had rained the night before and earily that morning. I only wish Id had my gun with me. I would have shot the two of them and stole their spaceship. That is, If it was even on the ground. I dont know, I didnt see one from where I was.

       "       \"Around the evening of January 2nd, 2008 I was driving home from my girlfriend's house in the countryside surrounding Shippensburg Pennsylvania.  I noticed an aircraft in the  distance around 10-20 miles away.  At first it did not seem out of the ordinary but I noticed that the craft began to move in ways that no human aircraft that I know of could move. It would hover over an area but then it would move instantly in another direction. It seemed that it could move in any direction and  be able to stop instantly. I am not an aviation expert but I do not believe that any human aircrafts could have been able to move like this one did. I was alone on a country road and I pulled my car over and stared at the object for several minutes. It moved throughout the valley in the way I described before it suddenly zipped far away out of site. At the time I did not know how to react to what I saw, but around 6 months later I was talking to  friend when he told me that he had seen an object while driving on the Pennsylvania turnpike that same night. By the way he described the object I could tell he saw the same object. Also he told me that the traffic on the turnpike nearly came to a complete stop as all of the drivers were looking at the object. I would not be surprised if other people reported seeing this object as well.  I do know that Letterkenny army base, which has been used as a testing zone for covert military activities was within 20 miles of where I was when I saw the object. The object appeared to be triangular in shape, but I did not get a very good look at the object since it was off in the distance. What stood out for me was the irregular way in which the object moved, I have never in my life seen an aircraft move in that way. I consider myself a rational person and I don't consider myself a believer of alien visitors or abductions. I do know however that on that evening I saw something that I cannot explain, I hope that this report can help us piece together the puzzle and someday be able ! to figur e out exactly what the UFO phenomenon is.

       "       \"3 UFO's spotted in the same spot as another before months ago, apparently watching me. I would just like to report this possible sighting, and let you know beforehand that I have seen one before in exactly the same spot last february at sometime; although I chose not to report it. Anyway, onto the event I witnessed (just moments ago, I might add). I was stroking my cat at the window of my dining room, strange yes but I like animals. I decided to check the skies, literally in the hopes of spotting something like this. I spotted a star, and looked up at it for a while before realising something: it was rather bright considering no other stars were visible, and appeared to be flickering slightly. I looked closer, making out what I think to be the shape of a disc. I looked around to see if there were anymore, to my relief and dissapointment I saw none. However, when I looked back I glimpsed as another seemed to shoot straight out of it and dissapear in moments. Of course, at this I knew something was awry. It dissapeared for a while, at which I thought I was imagining things. But, it returned, along with another, brighter one flying lower to underneath the other with flashing lights. I disgarded it as a helicopter, thinking maybe all was well. But then they both just dissapeared, like that. I checked again after and they haven't returned. Please look into this, the other sighting I had mirrored this pretty well As soon as I spot them they go, almost as if they are watching me. Please, I do not wish to be abducted at all, and my discussions with other believers on the internet may have gotten them interested in me (I intend to uncover it all in a few years time). I would be greatly assured to know either result. Thank you. P.S.My email is genuine, although I do not wish to give you my adress; my whole family already mocks me.

       "       \"Has anyone else had experiences with an insect-type being?   I do not know if this was a dream, or if I was being dropped back off after being abducted.  All I recall was waking up in the middle night after feeling like I was dropped back down to my couch. It was dark in whatever room I was in, but surely it could have been a dream. I remember yelling at this being, while I was laying down. Further, the being looked like an insect, but stood upright. It had antennae coming from its head. The idea I got after I woke was that it was a locust being. I compared it to a locust for some reason.  After I woke, whether dream or not, I recall a loud humming noise above my place outside. The sound was subtle, but noticeable. I hear these sounds above my house after waking up all the time (always in the middle of the night). Generally, I will go to the bathroom after waking, and hear this sound of some craft, plane, etc. before or during my trip to the bathroom. Many times, I hear this, but do not feel any other strange symptoms or problems after waking.  One thing for sure is: I have never been harmed,, to my knowledge, in any way. Therefore, although I have no clue what is going on with all of these visitors: they do not seem to be harming me: atleast nothing I know of.  That's all I have to give for the time being!\",\n",
       "       'It came from the direction of the city, when I stood on a hill in total darkness in the countryside. It was moving strangely,  not straight forward, but shaking a little left-right, like a drunk, wiht a slight noice. When it stopped for a short time, I suddenly heard a sudden bang and human like scream. Then it was gone silently. Maybe somebody was abducted? It was definitely no  helicopter..',\n",
       "       \"Saw saucer shaped UFO that gave me the impression that it was looking for me. I was walking from the bus stop to my house and decided to stop in the park to use the laptop (better internet access with wireless broadband) before I went home. I sat there for about fifteen minutes, I was already sick and I felt ...as crazy as this sounds... an external 'annoyed/go inside/getting sick' that wasn't my mind or emotions. As if something was annoyed at me for being so reckless, sitting in the cold while sick. It suddenly got urgent. 'Go home' I literally heard. As if I was in danger sitting there, beyond getting the flu of a lifetime. (I know this sounds like a prank and I feel crazy for admitting I heard/felt that, but you wanted to know everything...) I walked home and as I stood on the driveway, I had lost my key and I sat down outside. I sat there for about five minutes, waiting for housemate to finish putting baby to bed so she could let me in, and I saw something. It was about fifty metres away, the size of half a penlid, and coming diagonally towards me.  It was heading straight for the park.  It was a saucer shape, had some lights... that blurred in my eyes so I cannot say how many but some were larger than others... and I suddenly felt like it was lookingfor me, expecting me at the park, and that I HAD to get indoors. It made no noise, even though it was low down, we have planes that cross over much higher that we can hear (They don't follow the path it took and they are much much higher, always the same route for them.)... it was close, low, and it was upwind, but I still heard no sound from it. I got inside as soon as I could and even though I felt scared, I for some reason went to my room. I lay down. I woke up about 23:00, feeling like I had woken from being under general anesthetic (I had surgery in 07 so I remember the feeling well), all groggy and strange.  Soon I went back to sleep and slept it off. We see many planes going over us but none follow the route this UFO took, they are all heard easily, and they never come down as low as it was. I've seen one UFO before this, but I can't remember what date it was as I was a child, and a strange event happened to me when I was about three or four years old. A huge flash of light during a thunderstorm and more... sound, something outside... but not a lightning bolt (see below), I was scared suddenly beyond anything I'd ever felt(even though I had been watching the storm for about an hour and was used to the lightning), I thought lightning had struck the window... it was that bright, that incredible. I assumed it was a lightning strike outside the window because of the sound/something there... But when I went to parent's room, they hadn't heard or seen a thing. From that day on, I was scared of one type of alien only. ALl others I liked to watch in movies... not that we really watched any at that age...but from that age right to now, I cannot watch sci-fi movies with one particular type of alien. It wasn't that I'd been exposed to alien movies as a child, I was only a toddler... it just always was, I always knew about them, I literally grew up knowing, like I know that there are lions in Africa type of know. It's only recently, since I moved out of that house and bedroom, that I allowed myself to think it was more than a lightning strike. There's a similar flash on youtube of a possible abduction with a big flash. So I've always had things happen, always seen things, always known.\",\n",
       "       \"Very large long white cylinder object traveling high up and smoothly above storm clouds. Background- Exactly two weeks prior, I had seen another UFO.  Plus a history of sightings, strange behavior/time loss and possible abduction aged 3-4. I was walking home admiring the sunset and the beautiful clouds. I had calmed down over what I'd seen two weeks ago, and didn't expect to see anything anytime soon. I was about to cross a road when I saw something strange very very high up, up above the high atmosphere clouds. It was a long cylinder, perfectly white. I thought at first that it was an airplane making a trail, but as it came out from above the clouds, the 'trail' suddenly stopped and the end of it moved with the front... and I realized it was a cylinder shaped object. It had to be huge- it was almost three centermetres long from my standing spot but it was very much above the storm clouds as they grew. It was white, didn't reflect the sunset like the clouds did, and I only watched it for a few minutes before it went over another big cloud. It was heading into the wind direction, though I don't know if it had wind that high up. Compared to the last sighting, this one was peaceful. I got the impression that it was indifferent to me, it knew I had seen it but didn't care either way. It was very big. I can submit drawings of it but I had no camera on me.\",\n",
       "       \"Sphere shaped firework over Norwalk On 7/26/01 we first saw the unexplained object hoovering up in the sky there were 2 I thought nothing of it until my daughter said it was freaky because it would not move so I went to look and yes for about 15 minutes they just hovered we went to the front yard to just look at them one came real close to our home after about an hour it cane down hovered then soon after just shot up into the sky they both disapeared. It was so strange and scary I didn't know what to do so I called the news no answer I called the Air Force they said it was nothing but yet 2 minutes later 2 jets flew over. I was pregnant at the time and you hear so many stories I was afraid that maybe they were here for the baby. I stayed up all night alerted by every sound not knowing what it was. By the morning no news of any sightings were on any news channels. I did not go to work because I started having light contractions. Me and my children were the only ones out there and the next day I gave birth I was still worried about so called abductions when I was sent back to my room my baby wasn't with ne I started to panic and asked the nurse said the doctor would come talk to me. I was terrified not knowing until I asked to see my baby he was in ccu he had a few medical issues water in the lungs and would need to stay a few days. I always wondered if it was because of that night. My kids tease my son that he is an alien baby or we call them our friends now. Tonight my dog made a weird noise that made me look out the window and the object is up there I went outside to get a closer look because it had moved to fast and it was gone. I still see some flashing lights up in the sky and wonder if it's the same object. It looks like a sphere flashing red lights with white like whe a firework is set off and it spins. I know that there are lots of weird things but this time I don't know I wish someone else shared the same sighting. I will wait and see if anyone will ever see the same thing we have seen and what it is or if it wants something.\",\n",

       "       'Very Shiny and Reflective Saucer seen on the South side of Craig, Colorado Summer of 1995   I was unaware there was a site such as this to post your experiences.  My buddy and I had agreed not to report what we seen for fear that we would be laughed at. My parents live on the west side of Craig, Colorado, and I left there to pick my buddy up at his place which was a townhouse also on the west side of Craig.  The weather was a clear blue sky without any clouds so to speak.  We had decided we were going to go the Village Inn to eat and as we headed east on Highway 40/Victory Way toward the Village Inn my buddy said is that a \"jet\" as he pointed to the south side of town???  I said yeah that\\'s a \"jet\" as I looked I could see a jet flying along with a vapor trail.  He said not there over there!  I looked and said I don\\'t know what the h*ll that is.  As we were driving I noticed a guy walking along the highway that was looking in the direction of the object also.  I said lets get closer to it and we drove east and turned south on to Ranney Street.  We pulled up underneath the craft around the area of 1st Street.  I estimated it to be about 100-150 feet across and it looked like the common description of a saucer.  It had an eleva! ted center area and was disc shaped and was made of a very reflective and highly shiny metal.  I could see the sun reflecting on the side of it extremely bright!  I collaborated with my buddy the whole time to confirm what I was seeing.  At a distance it looked like the object was sitting in space on an exact point without moving at all.  When we got closer I could tell the object was rotating about a central axis like a top at an extreme speed.  It was holding exact position without a bobble and didn\\'t make a sound.  We sat there and looked at it in awe when it started rotating faster and faster!  I said it\\'s speeding up on its rotation right?  My buddy said yes it is.  Then it began to change shape flattening out like a cigar with the elevated center area completely gone and then in an instant it vanished completely!  I asked my buddy am I seeing things or did it just vanish!  He exclaimed yes it vanished completely.  This first time seeing the object I guessed it lasted ! about 12 minutes.  I looked further south and said there it is! again! We sped south to the intersection that heads east to the golf course and airport.  It was hovering like before and we sat there and looked at it again and like before it changed shape and vanished!  This time the viewing was for about 5 minutes.  Then we seen it again east of the airport so we headed east and as we got up on it began to change shape once again like before and in an instant it was gone.  It never reappeared after this time.  The whole duration of us watching the object was probably around 20 minutes.  We honestly couldn\\'t believe what we just saw.  If I was to see a UFO I always thought it would be a brief passing in the night.  I\\'ll never forget this that\\'s for sure.  We seen this object so often and I had heard of abduction and people having their memories erased.  We checked our watches pretty closely to make sure there was no missing time.  I think I would still be scared to be hypnotized.  My buddy was from Grand Junction, Colorado and I haven\\'t talked ! to him in years. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date is approximate.

       "       'abducted as a child in Tampa, FL, in the 1960s   I was a sleeping elementary school age child, in my own room and in my own bed in Tampa, FL when suddenly, there was light in my room,except the room had no overhead light and I hadn\\'t turned on the light next to my bed. This bedside lamp was the only normal source of light in this room. It was off but there was still much light. This had never happened before. I had a fast impression of someone being next to my bed. I saw, momentarily, what I perceived to be blue jeans on a man\\'s lower body then, with the light still on, but no one next to me,there was suddenly a lot of noise and commotion. In the next instant, \"The Sound of Music\" record played very loudly, presumably from the little portable record player in our living room. My room shared a common wall with the living room. When it went on, I sat bolt upright in bed. My first thought was that someone was there to murder us but I dismissed that idea with the thought that murderers probably didn\\'t make all of this commotion-a killer would be quiet. The music was turned up so loudly that I couldn\\'t believe that my siblings would do something this unusual and dangerous, knowing how violent our parents were. Whichever child was doing this was risking a horrible beating FOR SURE. I touched my bedroom wall with my hand to prove to myself that I was awake. The wall was solid and normal and I could see and feel the paint. I believed I was awake and I laid back down, in terror. Someone was present and making a tremendous amount of ruckus. I was shaking. Then there was a staticy feeling in the air. The room was now dark, the music stopped. I went into shock when I then saw 4 grotestue, blue, wrinkled troll-looking beings in what looked to me to be blue overalls. They were lined up in front of my closet. I thought they looked like drums because they were as stout as they were tall. They weren\\'t tall like a human, they were maybe 3 1/2 - 4 feet tall9maybe smaller) and so wide they were like squares.I must presume that the light must have been back on for me to see them so clearly, to be able to make out color but I didn\\'t think about the light. I was rapidly processing that these were real aliens and this event was really happening, then I was paralyzed. I felt like every molecule in my body was being pulled through the soles of my feet. I fought with all of my will but could not stop the paralysis or the pulling, which was happening very fast. I was totally and completely terrified. The next thing I can remember is being on a grate-type bridge walkway that went into a building or something large. I had the thought that \"this is definately happening to me and no one, not even my mother, will ever be able to help me. I wondered if they were going to keep me. Then, things get confusing in my own ability to be sure of the order of any of the following things that happened. In the place with all the grating, someone was somehow, maybe telepathically telling me that there was a problem somewhere. I was shown a darkened room with giant preying mantises just walking around. I think there was a window or something between me and them because they didn\\'t seem to notice or care about me in any way. Then I was shown a cloaked being in the same room I was in, who I automatically presumed was an old what-ever-she-was because she was very wrinkled and seemed very weak. I was shown this from a perspective of first being behind \"her\", to her right. I saw the dark cloak then the being who was at my side walked me up to look at her face. He told me more about the problem these beings had but its vaque to me. My impression was that whatever the problem was it had led to her appearance and weakness. I remember being in a smaller craft, seeing the stars go by very fast through a window, feeling very alone, and once again realizing that this was real. I definately thought then that I was the only human in this craft. They didn\\'t treat me like a child. There was no comfort offerred, no food, no water, no blanket and no one to help me. It was all matter-fact, like in this transport the beings were just performing a normal routine thing. Again, I\\'m not sure of the order of events as I only have snippets of scenes in my memory. I remeber walking, with no resistence and not much fear, concern or even interest now. I just went along willingly. I don\\'t know who was with me at this point but my best recollection is of someone short. We passed two human-looking beings to our left. There was a little girl with dark brown or black hair just kind of standing to the left of a large glass cylinder. A human man with dark hair was in the large cylinder. It looked like a large test tube. They didn\\'t take any significant notice of me and oddly I now realize, I didn\\'t make any effort to communicate with them. We never made eye contact. I never even tried to. As we kept walking, he(?), the being, now on my right, continued telling me I don\\'t remember what-until he had me look down at small horizontal portals or screens that showed different military things including an arial view of a large rocket with smoke and \"things\" flying around it. My impression was \"war\" I felt sadness and I definately said or thought loudly \"If you know all this, show me how I\\'m going to die\" and he did. He showed me a larger vertical screen and I watched myself, as an adult woman with long dark hair walking alone into a high floor of a ski chalet. There was a large picture window and I looked out upon a beautiful scene below of trees and lots of snow. Now, at this point, I feel more like I\\'m living it rather than watching it. I walked toward the main living room type area. Maybe 8, 10 people were in the living room, most sitting on sofas and some just milling about. I remember thinking that there should be no problem here because I knew most or all of the people. I started to walk to a sofa to sit down and a man just came up behind me and slit my throat. It felt like a true event happening in real time. I felt like I was blacking out, dying, and my last thought in this scenario was \"I can\\'t believe this could happen. I know all of these people. Why isn\\'t someone helping me? Was this a plot they were all in together?\". Then I was back, standing in front of this vertical scene, with the being who had no emotion about my death scene. None. I asked so he showed me. It was just a matter of future history, nothing personal on his part in any way. From there, things are very \"fuzzy\". I felt like I was lying down, in a different place, kind of flooating, then on(?) a white table, with doctors around me and the table, mostly to the left side of me. I felt euphoric-a feeling I would now liken to a narcotic only more exaggerated. One of the doctors said my name!  I felt something like a metal rocket-shaped \\'thing\\' being inserted. I was somehow okay with this!  The next memory is of me in a small spaceship, traveling in my parent\\'s yard to my bedroom window. The being piloting, to my left, was very blond and looked almost like a human male adult but my sense was that he was not human. His skin was too white-opague and his demeanor was like \"nothing\". There only seemed to be room for the two of us in this craft but I could see all around us. I think he telepathically mentioned ants and aloe vera as we flew over some. I\\'m not sure if I really remember the aloe vera-ant thing or if I conflabbed it. We were very low to the ground. We neared my window and I thought \"Oh, we\\'re going in my window\" but we did not. Still in the small craft, I remeber vividly that I felt very raw (emotionally, not physically), invaded, disappointed, very saddened. Something had been taken from me, from my body. I felt a sad emptiness and the being imparted to me \"Its done. There\\'s nothing you can do about it\" My regret seemed to surprise or confuse this being. Maybe even irritation would describe his affect. This was the only millisecond of \"feeling\" that I received from him. \"Disturbance of the norm\"  I heard two whistling, spinning noises, I felt cold, I felt a little spinning then I SAW my own bedcovers UNDER me as I flew into place in my own bed. I don\\'t recall waking up that morning but I obviously did and just went about the morning like it was a normal day. I remembered later in the same day that this had happened. I was walking from my elementary school lunchroom, in line with my classmates, headed back to class when I remembered. I knew the word schizophrenic and knew if I told my mother she would take me to a psychiatrist and that would be what they would say. I knew it had really happened but believed I was the only person in all of history that this had happened to or would happen to. I made my mind up on that sidewalk that day that for my own protection, I could never tell a living soul. I have no idea if this was one event or numerous events that my mind has spliced together. I only remember the paralysis and sucking through the feet feeling happening one other time. I was even more terified the second time and totally determined not to go again. With all my will and strenghth, I moved my right little finger and the paralysis was broken. I\\'ve never had the feeling again, never been taken anywhere and have had no conscious awareness of any aliens anywhere since then. The most important thing I can tell you is that when I returned home from school that day and went to use our restroom, I had a straight red line from my naval to my pubis. It was shocking to me but also forced me to admit the reality of this whole thing to myself. The red line looked like a perfect surgical incision had been made and closed but there were no suture marks, no staples, no apparent source of closure. The red line was perfectly straight and is visible to this day. It has become a thin brown line visible from about 3 inches from my naval down to the top of the pubis. I definately welcome inspection of this \"scar\" by medical researchers. No doctor or boyfriend has ever noticed or commented on it. Later, maybe 5 or 10 years later when I first read of animal mutalations, I had chills and anxiety. I felt certain this was the work of the beings who took me. I was a straight A student but a compartmentalized nervous wreck from then until recently. I could not become truly emotionally connected to anyone and I lived in complete terror that something like this would happen to my own daughters. When they came to take me the second time, I felt I was marked in some way or how would they know to take ME again?  Since in the death scenario I had long dark hair and was an adult - once I became an adult I dyed my hair blond, kept it short and knew I would never live in or go to places with ski chalets and snow. Now 54, I find myself in Colorado because I need to live near my oldest daughter who lives here. She is my primary care giver and I truly need her help - so I\\'m here. I have a devastating terminal disease. Prior to this disease I now have, I lived only in hot places -FL and NV I was so determined to not live out the death scene. I have neuromyelitis optica and I am now blind. My immune system is shredding my nervous system one cranial nerve at a time. This began in the 80\\'s.It is a very rare disease and one of the few conditions that causes both blindness and paralysis in the patient, then leads to death by the failure of the intercoastal muscles.  I hated the beings my whole life. I hated that they took an innocent, already traumatized child without even asking the child. It was a violent kidnapping in my opinion. Now that I am aware of so many stories similar to mine, I\\'m calmer in one respect(I\\'m not the ONLY one) but now, I\\'m very concerned for all humankind. What is going on?!  I have been diagnosed with PTSD from chilhood abuse and adult onset PTSD from going blind. A more correct diagnosis would have been lifelong PAS, I have no doubt. To clarify one of answers regarding number of craft seen-I said 3. I may have seen one from the outside, in my yard, during the same event but everything else was inside a craft. I count them as 1-the grating & preying mantises, the little girl, the death scene and the medical stuff 2-the craft in which I was flown rapidly by a military type \"crew\" and 3- the tiny ship from which the blond took me across the yard and into my room. I had a horrible childhood in every possible way because of the on-going anxiety and terror from this event, the constant beatings from my adoptive parents and a year of molestation by my 5th grade teacher. I became a life-long loner. In the 90s, I told one friend and both of my daughters of the event. All three said they believed me, which makes it possible for me to tell you now. I also told a boyfriend who was a paramedic and is now a nurse in a infant and children\\'s trauma ward in LV. He did not believe my story was real but does believe that I believe it. He believes that this is a cover story created by my mind because I cannot accept that I was raped as a child. He doesn\\'t believe in UFOs and thinks we are alone in this vast universe. I was NOT raped as a child. Beaten by parents, molested by a teacher but there was no rape event. I can\\'t really care if anyone believes me or not. It doesn\\'t change any of what happened. I feel like my whole life was stolen from me. I\\'ve not had one day since the event that I felt normal or that I fit in anywhere. There is some relief in knowing that people, lots of people worldwide, now know of these kinds of abductions and that there is at least investigation being done now. I used to pray that one day there would be a registry or someway to tell legitimate researchers and scientists what happened to me in the hope of one day really understanding why they picked me. Because I believe it neccessary for my good mental health to forgive them, I do, to a point, but I still hate the little, blue drum-like ones who took me with absolutely no regard for me, my terror, my youth. I like to think that if they ever came along now that I wouln\\'t be frightened of them. I think I would be bold and demand some answers this time. I worry about, but also look forward to some kind of event where all the abductees are made known to the world so people will know that this really happened to lots of us and perhaps, is still happening to some people, especially children. I believe I saw 6 different kinds of aliens : 1-the horrible little blue drum-like ones who took me, 2-the preying mantises,3- the \"crew\" of the shuttle 4-the \"explainer\" who walked me past the two humans and showed me the \"war\" pictures and my own alleged death. 5- the doctors and 6-the very white man who took me home through my ceiling. Very oddly, I have no direct recall of any of the \"greys\" with the big eyes, claimed by so many abductees but I also can\\'t tell you what the\"crew\" or the \"explainer\" or the doctors looked like at all. I don\\'t know why I can\\'t remember something this important, but in 40+ years I\\'ve never remembered their faces. I was adopted at birth from McDill AFB and have speculated that the doctor who knew my name might have been a human military doctor. In 1979 I had to have an emergency surgical procedure (a right oophorectomy) because my right ovary had become gangrenous from \"torsion of the tube\". No eggs were visible in this ovary upon removal nor upon follow-up microscopic examination. No doctor was able to explain this or determine where my eggs were,  or if there had ever been any in that ovary. I had a normal pregnancy in 1980 and gave birth to my second daughter. She has extra vertebrae in her neck and was born with eyes so almond-shaped I worried for a time that she might be mongoloid. She is not. In 1983, following the 1979 removal of my right ovary and a 1982 surgical procedure to eliminate some of the remaining left fallopian tube to insure contraception, and with my partner having had a vasectomy, I was told that I was pregnant again. I lost the baby and all the attending physician would tell me is that the baby was not normal. I was not shown the baby. In 2008, following 7 years of total menopause and having no partner for 8 months, as my boyfriend had died, I was again told I was pregnant. I was 52 years old. I was hospitalized for 3 days and all 12 blood pregnancy tests came back positive, as well as all urine tests. The hospital lab was in a bit of an uproar about \"the old, blind pregnant lady with no partner\". I was released into the care of my family practioner who administered a blood pregnancy test in her office two weeks later. It came back negative. (The emergency room doctor seemed extremely interested in the fact that I had torsion of the tube in my 20s but he never elaborated. He just seemed very excited and interested in this fact. So much so that I wondered then and I wonder now, WHY was this of so much interest to him? As his name is on the medical record as the admitting doctor, I hope one day someone will ask him why this was a big deal to him. No other medical professional has ever raised an eyebrow when I mention it, yet he was incredulous and focused on it at length. He then performed an ultrasound and determined that my womb was empty. He admitted me, baffled). Because I had chemotherapy in 2007-09 for this neuromyelitis optica, my doctor believes I was experiencing endocrine changes. I think this is likely correct as I have had no other encounters since the 60s of which I am aware. Truthfully, I think the neuromyelitis is a result of both the chil abuse and the abduction. I think it was all too much for my nervous system. I see a very qualified neuro-opthomologist who has no idea at all why I have this disease. I\\'ve never had the courage to tell any medical professional treating me or any mental health professional of the abduction because I believe they will label me \"insane\". I\\'m not. I have been troubled and anxious for 40+ years. I have attempted suicide too many times to count (okay, 5). The most recent event, in 2008, was a compulsive act that I felt was not entirely of my own accord. Suddenly, one afternoon, I wanted very much to put a screwdriver through my left wrist, which makes absolutely no sense to me. I did not do that but with almost an uncontrollable intensity, I took an over-dose of Wellbutrin and Prozac. Somehow, I took just the right combination for the drugs to balance each other out and though I spent the night in intensive care, I had almost no effect from the 15 pills or more that I ingested. No nausea, no vomiting, no convulsions, not even a hiccough. I can\\'t believe how out of control of myself I felt while taking the over-dose. It was a manic event that still doesn\\'t make sense to me. Never have I heard of \"death by screwdriver\" and I\\'m no handyman. Usually, I don\\'t even own a screwdriver and have never at any other time thought about a screwdriver in any odd way like this. I am a mother. If I were really going to intentionally kill myself there is no doubt that I would leave lengthy letters of explanation for my adult daughters. I would make logical plans, I would give away treasured momentos, I would say good-bye to those I love, yet, I didn\\'t do any of this. I just felt  this over-whelming impulse to put a screwdriver through my own wrist. Instead, I took lots of pills very quickly. I remember counting 12, 13, 14...like they were M&Ms, instead of strong medications. I was a medical professional myself (an EMT and medical writer) and NEVER would I do this. And yet, I did. The other 4 attempts prior were clustered from 2001 to 2004 and were also compulsive acts. No planning, just action that seemed to be out of me instead of from me. I tried to jump off a mountain (my daughter decked me to keep me from doing this), I ran out into traffic (everyone stopped), I went to a desolate location in an attempt to die from exposure and starvation (this was clearly going to take a long time and be painful) and I asked someone I didn\\'t know to get heroin for me so I could over-dose. I took twice the amount they said would be dangerous and waited. All I got was a headache. Obviously, I\\'m not very good at suicide. I don\\'t think I will ever try again because now, if I felt the compulsion, I would resist totally. Enough of my life has been taken from me by others. Once I made the connection that the US military was probably involved in this, which was only recently, I began to feel much stronger but also even more angry. What do I think? I think I was taken by aliens but that the doctor who knew my name was human and that both were somehow benefitting from whatever they did to me. I truly think I was selected because I was an adoptee from an AFB and was already traumatized. Obviously, all of the medical information I am recounting is verifiable through medical and hospital records, which I\\'m happy to provide to any legitimate researcher. I welcome the opportunity to have truth serum administered and would agree to be hypnotized by a medical professional. In both scenarios I would ask that a video recording be made of the entire questioning procedure and I would want a trained UFO researcher present in both cases. Its taken my whole life to put these snippets together. I remembered some of it that day but was an adult before I realized why I always had to have a rectangular white dining table. I could almost remember but not quite, then one day in Sarasota, FL, following the purchase of my 3rd or 4th white rectangular table, I remembered. I was on one. I think it possibly emitted white light. How else would I know it was white if I was lying on it? I don\\'t remember anyone removing my clothing, nor do I know how my clothing was returned to my body. Unlike the other stories I\\'ve been reading on the Internet, I was not shown any babies or told anything about hybrids. I wasn\\'t asked to touch or hold anything or anyone. I now think they took eggs from my right ovary and I think they left the fallopian tube and ovary malpositioned which resulted in the torsion. It might have been intentional because the gangrene certainly made it impossible for doctors to tell what had happened to my right ovary and eggs. I believe they take children because we are closer to their size. Even now as I write this, I feel sick to my stomach and sweaty. I would give most anything to know the whole truth of what happened to me - and apparently others- and WHY. Finally, let me say that I am a professional writer and have been virtually my whole adult life. If I were going to make up a story, I promise you, it would make a lot more sense than this. I WISH I was making it up. Though it happened to me, it remains almost too incredible for me to believe but the scar is still there. Before she passed in 2003, my mother and I spoke of the scar. All she really said was \"yeah, you have had that for a long time.\" I don\\'t know why she said this because NEVER did I show it to her or tell her about it in any way. She never commented if and when she really ever saw it, yet she acted like \"yeah, aliens, no big deal.\" No surprise, no questions. I thank you with my whole heart for providing this forum to people like myself who have kept this horrible secret inside ourselves for our whole lives. I hope someone will contact me and help me sort it out. Due to the blindness, phone contact is the best way to reach me. I would accept a collect call but I only have a cell phone and they don\\'t permit collect calls. I can\\'t read my own e-mail and must have others read it for me. I would prefer not to have to talk about it with anyone except a valid researcher. Thank you very much - and if you are connected to the military in any way DO NOT contact me. And I better not have any MIBs hanging around once I submit this to you. I am so NOT even kidding. If I am contacted by ANYONE except a UFO researcher, I WILL DENY that I wrote this and swear that it never happened. If you are truly valid UFO researchers, I hope you will know by content that this DID happen. Please give me a chance to provide the little proof that I have (the scar).

       "       'For about 10 minutes, my father and I watched a solid dot move in a zig-zag pattern across the night sky moving to the Northeast. My father and I were outside looking at a clear night sky.  Suddenly, we saw this light moving at a moderate speed across the night sky heading Northeast.  We knew it could not be a plane, satellite, or falling star because the flight path was very eradict.   The light kept moving at a zig-zag pattern from west to east will continue to go towards the northeast.   We both watched the object for 10 minutes before it finally moved out of our sight range.

       "       'woman figure in red bodysiut with large head   Sometime during 1981 I had a dream that has not left my memory.  I now believe it was not a dream but an abduction experience.  This occurred in Huntsville, Alabama at night. I have three memories: I was placed in a seat that looked like plastic similar to fast food restaurants.  It was curved and had a high back that protruded above my head.  I was not belted in the seat but I was stuck there and could not move.  My eyes were open but unable to move so I could only see in front of me.  There was a man sitting across from me in a same type of seat, and he was not moving either.  I could see more seating behind him but with the design I could not see anyone sitting. The second memory I woke up and was on a table in the middle of a room.   I was laying with my head in the south and my feet in the north.  My eyes could not look around, but I could see part of the ceiling and part of the wall on my right.  It appeared to look rounded and somewhat reminded me of commercial office partitions, grey/silver and flat.  I did not know where I was, then my head rolled to the left and I saw a woman walking up a small ramp to a door that I heard open with a \"swish\" sound, like a hatchback car when you open it.  I could see a little of the hall way and it appeared to curve slightly. The woman was wearing a red bodysuit and seemed to be physically fit.  I saw her head was different, it was larger in the back like it was deformed and her hair was blonde and extremely thin like a chemo patient that is losing most of their hair.  She was on the west side of the room and to the left of me. She had to know I was looking at her from behind because after the door opened she quickly turned and looked at me.  I saw her in the front view before she knocked me back out apparently with her mind, she did not say anything.  Her body seemed human but I have never seen a face similar to her. She had a bigger forehead and bigger eyes than a human, her nose was extremely small, almost no cartilage and reminds me of Michael Jacksons small nose.  Her mouth was small too with very thin lips. The last memory I was in a different seat facing west looking at black windows.  I saw the seat I had been in and it was emply, I still could not look around but I saw a door to the north behind the seat I was in in the first memory.  I was next to the wall and remember the rectangle rounded windows. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date during 1981 is approximate.  PD))',\n",
       "       'Fully visible  flying saucer Myself and my two cousins were out in front of our Grandmothers playing with remote controlled cars.  We for some reason looked up to the night sky to see a disc shaped craft approximately 100 to 200 feet in length and  maybe 50 feet in height.  The craft was very low in the sky maybe fifty feet taller then your average telephone pole and It had several different colored lights circling the craft and several black \"windows\" around the saucer.  The craft was a light grayish blue color that to this day I have never seen on any aircraft.  It passed over our grandmothers house making no sound at all.  We witnessed it in the front for about one minute moving very, very slowly as if it was studying us.  We then ran through the house to the back yard and the saucer was gone.  I spent four years in the United States Marine Corps working in and around aircraft from several branches of the military.  I have never seen an aircraft that matches the color or metal con! struction to this aircraft.  The saucer appeared to be one smoothly constructed craft something that I have never seen since.  I have seen other things in the sky since then and have heard numerous stories from around this area, even a couple of abduction stories, and was wondering what information if any you guys had on this area.

       "       'Strange looking craft and possible lost time   I’m not sure on the exact date but it was when I was 6 or 7 which that would make it around 1967 or 1968 and the month/day/time I’m not sure of either.  What I am sure of is myself, brother, mother and father were standing in our front yard in Mt Washington, Maryland, and we saw this craft slowly drifting across in front of us about 300 feet away and 300 feet up.  It was not an airplane, helicopter, glider, balloon, inflated object (hoax) or anything we have ever seen.  It reminded me now of the Jefferson airplane blimp if you ever seen that on their album or poster.  It sort of looked like a cross between a box kite and balloon but was not either of those at all.  It was close enough that I remember seeing the operator of this craft staring at us, as it drifted by.  Time seemed to stand still and it also seemed as though we were under the control of the operator of this craft--very, very strange indeed.  I think about this often and would love some answers.  I have other experiences which have happened later on in my life which really make it seem as though I’ve been abducted several times.  I honestly don’t think these experiences were dreams and probably should have my brain tapped into to see. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))',\n",

We were laying on the grass at a school near my house, about a few minutes later- we saw something coming at us in the sky, it was oval shaped, and looked like a disk or saucer.  It  had yellowish windows that seemed to change  color to an orange-red.   It had tons of little windows the whole thing looked like a cartoon.  It came right at us and became 20 feet away.   We were so scared and ran off- we started to scream and cry.  We had left our phone so we went back for it, but we found it in our pocket.  By that time it had left, but we ran home.  When we got home we told my sister and my other cousins.  They didn’t believe us at first, but we looked so scared that they did.  It seemed like we were almost abducted.  We have seen many of these crafts before in the sky in a great distance, but this time it was coming towards us.  We have probably seen about 20 UFO's i! n the years 2008 and 2009 all together.

       "       'UFO near nuclear plant. I live in Metropolis, Ill. just about 15 miles east of Grand Chain. Let me give you the geography of were we are. Metropolis is the home of a plant that makes R238 or some kind of chemical for nuclear bombs. I beleive they call it \"yellowcake.\"  Over the Ohio river (in Kentucky) there is another plant  that takes this \"yellowcake,\" and refines it into, well, only the government knows.  In other words there is a lot of uranium in this area. One Sunday myself and two of my friends were on the road between Joppa, Ill, and Grandchain, Ill. This road runs a mile or two north of the Ohio River, but there are places that you can see the river. And this spot was one of those places.  We just passed over the Cache River bridge and was coming on a little rise and curve.  My male friend was driving, a female friend was in the passenger seat, and I was in the back seat behind the driver. I\\'ve been down that road hundreds of times so I knew to look to the south to get a view of the river.  Something caugh my eye just over the Illinois bank of the river.  I\\'m no good judging heights, but I would say it was 1000 ft. over the trees.Well, I don\\'t care if you believe me or not. I don\\'t want any plubicity. What it was, was an airplane, I don\\'t know much about planes but I swear to God it looked just like a piper cub, the kind where the wings are on top of the plane. ??  From the very instant I saw the plane I knew somthing was wrong.  The windows weren\\'t transparent.  The windows looked like it had silver looking tinting, and the plane was not moving at all.  It was just setting there.   I don\\'t recall ever saying a word to my friends.  As we were moving along the road  I kept watching the plane and all the sudden this huge green fireball came down to earth and exploded on the ground 3 times.  But made no noise at all. (Now keep in mind that that Kentucky nuclear plant is in sight just across the river). The wierdest part of this whole thing was right after the explosions (I\\'ll never forget this), I was turning my head around to look foreward I watched my two friends heads turn back foreward at the same time mine did.  We never said a word about it just went on down the road like nothing ever happened.  It\\'s like we forgot about it. Even though this happened back in 1976 we never spoke about this to one another.  EVER!  The female friend of mine died about 4-5 years ago of cancer and we never said a word about it to each other.  Every time we were around each other we just, I guess forgot or was blocked from saying anything to each other about it.   But another strange fact is that I can tell other people about what I had saw.  But after a few rolling eyes, I thought it best just to keep it to myself.  I\\'m getting older now and I had to tell someone that may actually believe me.  I\\'m just getting my first computer.  And if we were abducted I\\'m not going to be hypnotized to remember it.   Another funny thing is that I saw a show on ufo\\'s once and they were talking about having small pieces of metal in thier bodies.  Well, in 1987 I had surgury on my arm for radial tunnel.  The Dr. showed me my x-ray on day and ask what those two pieces of metal were.  Smaller than a BB and lodged just above my elbow on my left arm.  I have never injured my are in that location. If you don\\'t believe me, thats fine. I have never heard of a ufo looking like an airplane before either. But I swear this on my Grandma\\'s. I forgot to mention one thing.  There isn\\'t a time I go by there that I don\\'t think about that day.  I moved to Texas in 1979 and moved back to Metropolis in 1985.  My wife and I went down that road one day and the state of Illinois has bought the same property that thing exploded on and put a resturant right over the spot. Let me give you my summation of what we went through. [maybe]  (1) If it was a UFO they can transform there crafs to look just like earth planes [because there was no dought in my mind that thing I saw looked like a plane]   (2) Some kind of mind control was used on us or we would have been able to speak to each other about what we had saw.   (3) And it scares me to think I\\'ve got some kind of transmitter lodged in my arm. I\\'ll probably think of more things later that I wish I had said to you but had forgot.   But that\\'s it and that ((deleted--\"is true.\")) ((NUFORC Note:  Date may be approximate, although the witness does not indicate that fact.  PD))',\n",
       "       'Probable abduction   Not exactly sure as to date but certain on month and year. My girlfriend and I were exploring the backroads and small towns of the Appalachias and camping out of the back of my 1970 VW Squareback station wagon. It slept two quite nicely. And I\\'m 6\\'4\". We were a couple of hippie kids in our early twenties and I had found a dirt road off of US 421 at about 7:00pm as it was still daylight. This road had a lot of switchbacks and it was mainatined by Ashland Oil Company as we had seen multiple signs along this dirt road. I drove off of US 421 for approximately 15 miles and up to an elevation that might have been several hundred feet higher than where I had turned onto the dirt road. I stopped beneath a beautiful rock cliff that stretched about 100\\' above where I\\'d parked. The cliff was due east and a thickly forrested and very steep drop off was to our west. The car was oriented front facing north. We got our Hibachi out and cooked a couple small steaks and some veggies on it and hand about a third of a bottle of red wine between the two of us. We sat and talked as it got dark and we could make out a narrow band of sky and stars above us but most of the sky was no visible due to the cliff and the trees. At about 10:00 pm we decided to call it a night and settled into the VW for a good night\\'s sleep. It was warm but nice and the sky was clear the humidity was low and there were no bugs so it was a beautiful night for sleeping. We had the hatch open on the VW with the rear seats folded down and the front seats folded forward as to aloow as much length for stretching out as possible so I would say that my feet were probably about 6\"-10\" inside the car and my girlfriend was on my right side. I woke up and only could open my eyes but could not move. There was a LOT of brilliant blue white light (like an electric arc welder only more) shining into the car from BELOW our elevation, coming up the steep slope to the west. I could tell that it was from that origin due to the light shining onto the ceiling of the car and not down into the car. I must have been on my right side as I could see the VDO dash clock and it said it was about 1:00 am.  I should not have been able to see that clock as we were in the middle of nowhere and it had been pitch dark when we turned off the dome light at 10:00.  Sometime later a awoke again and this time I was lying on my back which struck me as odd as I had never slept on my back. I was looking at the headliner of the car and all I do was move my eyes.  There was a very even blue white light illuminating the inside of the car at this point but it was not very bright.  As I looked to my left I could see the B-Pillar moving away from my field of vision and I realized that I was moving out of the back of the car, flat on my back, unable to move.  I had the very definite sensation that there was something/someone moving around outside the rear of the car.  I immediatley thought \\'bears\\'.  I remember struggling to move but all I could do was move my eyes and the last thing I remembered was seeing the inside of the hatch window glide by and out of sight. The next morning was very strange as my girlfriend and I barely talked, tossed our stuff into the VW and drove to the nearest town in search of a restroom with plenty of cold water to splash on.  We made it to Hazard Kentucky and there was a little festival going on in town.  When I found a restaraunt I went to the men\\'s room and immediately noticed that I had about four days beard growth when I had shaved just 24 hours before.  My girlfriend was in even worse shape as she had started her period just the day before and she said that she was a \"mess\".  We both felt as though we had been drugged as we were kind of woozy and I remember pain in my neck and lower back and she reported pain as well. We didn\\'t really talk much about that experience for the next six years.  We were married for five of those years and the experience only came up once or twice. Thirteen years later in Bloomington,Indiana I was reading a book by Whitly Streiber and another book about abductions that I just happened upon at the county library and I flipped to the photos in the center of the book and there were B&W photos of \"scoop marks\" on people\\'s shins/lower legs. I about dropped the book because I knew that I had three perfectly proportioned scars on my right leg that were perfect matches to the photos I was looking at. I had know for years that I had these scars but I had never really questioned their origin.... That struck me as really weird because I can account for every little scar on my carcass but not these. And they are deep and would have been into the bone based on their dimensions. I\\'ve seen floating, dimly lit orbs once before this event when I was about ten and once after when I was about twenty-eight. That\\'s pretty much it..... I worked in high energy accelerator physics for about seventeen years after this event and I felt that it was possibly some sort of abduction event even though I was immersed daily in hard scientific facts. Feel free to contact me only if you feel that I may be of help to you. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that date of incident is approximate.  PD))',\n",

I moved my eyes around to my avail on my left side I saw what looked like a rounded expandable antenna held by a white hand moving towards the side of my head.  My dog was woken up and immediately jumped up off the bed and started growling and went into alert mode.  (Im a former Police Officer and K-9 Handler I work in Corrections Now and my dog is a working dog.)  Then my dog got low to the ground and was out of my sight.  The hand holding the antenna was now pointed at her and she stoped barking and growling.  I then was able to move a litle and was filled with unbridled rage.  I moved my eyes to the left and saw my alarm it said 5:35 A.M.  My left hand that had felt like it was being held down as I stated before being paralyzed now swung to my left with all the force in my body and made contact with a hard but latex feeling body. Immediately I jumped and looked to my left where this being was at previously and it was gone. And my alarm now stated it was 5:38 A.M. My girlfriend now woke up i told her to run into the living room and the dog followed her, I grabbed my 9mm Glock went into my living room cleared that room and cleared my apartment. I do not know what this was and why it had happened but I prayed to Jesus Christ to help me and he did. I have had many strange experiances but not on this magnitude and have always felt like I am being watched. I work 11pm to 7pm so I dont have to sleep at night.

       "       \"sightind and abduction on country road. We were going out to photograph, at night, blindly shooting down into gulleys  and streams, hollows and deep inside walled areas of trees.  Our hope was too catch animals off guard and maybe get interesting pictures. I was using a flash, on each and shot over a hundred pictures that night. We left at 8,30   Throughout  the entire evening,  we felt only that a calming ride in the country had occurred with possibly some good pictures . Pictures we'd view in the morning  on the computer. The next morning when I looked through them enlarging them on  photo gallery, I saw the two pictures and a few others.  I'm sending. 4 that night that I had no memory,, of taking. We had no memory at all of anything seen in the images, the craft, or the thing in front of the car.    No memory of being stopped.    We returned on the next night thinking something cool had happened seeing a UFO and  thought since we were unharmed it would be safe to return.  The next night we went we had similar results, a few more pictures that were strange even more frightening because of the activity in front of our car that could not be made out clearly. We were  slightly worried but more curious about the ship we had seen twice in the pictures. and after a few more days thought again it might be safe, so we returned with tape recorders in the car. And the things on the tapes were muffled but a few areas crystal clear,  one of these was our talking on the tape, and then the car stopping suddenly, the doors came open and my wife was drug out with a whimper, and the sound of me struggling in my seat unable to speak went on for some time, possibly 10 seconds, there was a humming sound in two short bursts, and I was heard struggling no longer, in fact neither of us  were heard. There is a point where a voice makes a sexual reference, one sentence,,  and then that yea their dumb.  Afterward, some time later( yea there almost ready. )  the sounds of  arranging equipment? Like picking up stuff , closing a container, etc. Within the next minute we start the car, pull away driving again, and resume the conversation we had been having before the incident. We returned home, ready for sleep, having no idea anything had occurred.  We had by mid-night the beginning of severe abdominal pain and rectal pain as well, identical. These conditions lasted for the better part of three days.  This and the things found on the tape made it clear what  had possibly  taken place . Again photos were in the large set ,of only a odd shaped vehicle outside the car stirring up dust.  Its strange sound on the tape.  There were other things said so disturbing to us, I destroyed the tapes.  The photos I'm sending are the clearest free of dust flakes that made the others unidentifiable.  We experienced a time loss of roughly an hour two times at least. During a recent  hospital trip a small round polished bead the size of a BB, the airgun ammo, was seen in my sinus cavity in a  x-ray.  Also, I have a hole on the back of my neck, near my hairline, that a  sewing needle could be inserted almost its whole length, eye first with no pain.  No blood or discharge of any kind.  It can still be seen.\",\n",
       "       'UFO, Almont Michigan, Tree Top Lelel, Humming Sound It was the fall of 1990; I was in my home in Almont, MI. That time of year it gets dark quite early, it must of been around 8:00 p.m., \"the times are now just an approximation\". My son, who at the time was around 12 came running in the house saying there was a UFO right outside our house. Let me add at this point I was not one that believed in UFOs. I went outside and my son pointed south and upwards and said look! The funny thing was at first I didn\\'t see anything, but I did notice it was unusually dark, then I noticed a very dim light, I suddenly realized that the reason it was so dark was that there was a huge craft right over our driveway. It blocked all the starlight! It was at tree top level and was moving north at a very slow pace, \"approximately a slow walking speed\". There was a very distinct humming, exactly like a large transformers hums, there was a very dull light in the middle and as it traveled down or driveway I made out a row of windows around the craft, the windows looked very large. I remember walking down the driveway with my son, and then the next thing I remember is standing out in the field north of my house still looking at the UFO, when suddenly it went from approximately 90 or 100 ft straight up in the sky to where it was a pinpoint of light. It just looked like another star. This happened in under a second. We continued to watch it for quite awhile when it took off in a northwesterly direction like a meteor and was gone in a second. There are allot of things I can describe if your interested, but this is the basic part.  I don\\'t feel like I was abducted, but I honestly do not remember how I got from my driveway and then in the field. I ask my son about it and he remembers things the way I do, but what I find unusual is that 1. I didn\\'t really focus on it that much after the initial day it happened until a few years ago. 2. My son doesn\\'t seem as interested as I am, even though he is a very intelligent guy. I have a lot of knowledge regarding aircraft. This will always go down as the most bizarre day in my life. By the way, it seemed like I was being watched by someone in the window, but it was like you could only make out a shadow. I am now fascinated by UFO\\'s and I know that there out there. Almont is about 20 SE of Brown City. I have never seen another unusual craft. This was defiantly a UFO, there is no other explanation for it, I am the type of guy that checks his facts, there is nothing on our planet that I am aware of that could do what I saw! The pilots would be dead just from the G forces.  It surprises me that there have been so many incidences in that area and I never heard about it. From my house to the field was approximately 1000 feet, “you would think that with what was going on, I would remember that sort of distance\". I am not really concerned weather anyone believes me or not, unless it is someone who’s job it is to investigate this sort of thing. They really need to have an open mind and check the facts. The last few years I have gotten increasingly interested in this subject and there have only been a few incidences that I have read about where people have been as close as I was. I guess I am just intrigued. It really fascinates me! The missing time, and it does bother me, when I put into perspective. I can remember everything about the sighting in detail except from the time the craft went from the barn behind my house until I remember standing in the field watching it go from an altitude of 90\\' to just another star in the sky in the blink of an eye. This is the most significant event in my life and I can\\'t remember just that particular part. I did have dreams afterward about all the neighbors being around looking and me yelling for them all to watch, but its a dream. I have brought it up several times to my son who is really a level headed intelligent guy and he remembers the same way I do, but he for some reason never brings it up himself. I really have to catch myself sometime to really put in perspective the significance about what happened that night. It just amazes the hell out of me. I really do think that somehow my mind was altered to either forget about it, or just not think it was that big a deal. Think about that, how could a person with the knowledge I have about aircraft not act in some way . This was the size of a football field! What it did breaks all laws of physics and for several years I really didn‘t give it that much thought. It is not like me. I had transformers on appliances that started to burn out. I called Detroit Edison and they had to replace all the electric lines and main transformer on the line that followed the driveway right below where the UFO was following. This was within a month of the sighting. I remember the Detroit Edison crews telling me that all the insulation on the wires were gone. I thought that was a bit strange, but since then I have read quite a few articles about sightings near power lines with the same or similar results. I was so close, 90 ft. The funny thing about it was I didn\\'t feel threatened, In a weird way I felt like it was something from our future, as bizarre as that sounds. I feel that we need to have confidence in our instincts; I felt like I was on display and was being watched. One thing I didn\\'t mention and to this day I am not sure why I didn\\'t act, is that I am a professional photographer. What a dummy! the shot of a life time and I didn\\'t even think about it. This is another thing I cant explain, I take my cameras everywhere with me. The first ten years, I would occasionally ask my son if he remembered everything about that night and he would say yes, but not really want to talk about it. It seemed like more of a dream. WHY? Neither my son nor I am the type of person not to act on something so significant, an event of a life time .Another factor about that night was the route the craft was traveling, right down my driveway. My power lines go right down the drive and sometime that winter I had to call Edison out, they told me that the wires were completely bare\" no insulation at all\", and had to replace them, including the transformer. I am not sure if it relates, but I have read stories about these craft using power lines. It\\'s funny, you hear people talk about UFOs and some people will tell you that they have seen one, but you never really stop and give it deep thought because it\\'s a bit hard to fathom the reality about them. I am now a person that can speak the truth about these craft, guess what, you better start polishing your tin foil hat because they are here. Think about all the incidents over the years, especially with all of the NASA sightings, even hovering over the White House. They always have an excuse, a flair, blimp, and the best and most used, a weather balloon. I am sure that a good percentage of reports are something explainable, but I am here to tell you, some aren’t. Sometimes I will think about it and realize that my son and I saw something that would be no less significant than telling your friends you met Jesus Christ. Well, you know what your friends would think. That’s why there are so many people that don\\'t believe, it’s really too big to grasp.

       "       'big blob of blinking rainbow lights I was looking out my window while laying in bed and i seen something strange out of the corner of my eye. i got up to look and there was this thing..for lack of a better word.. flashing different bright colors in the sky. it really caught my interest. i stood there staring at it. i came to the conclusion it was a ufo. just a huge mass of circular flashing lights blinking and as i watched, a million thoughts ran through my head. what was it doing? am i going to get abducted? does that stuff really happen? a car alarm went off and i heard sirens all while i watched this ..thing.  it stayed in one spot for about 5 min then eventually when i looked down to text  my friend to go look i look up and it was gone. i never saw anything like this before. it really amazed me.',\n",
       "       \"abducted by circular ufo while camping  I was camping in the Abbotsford outskirts area very late one night, and I was having issues sleeping because of my back, I was sitting outside by the campfire, when all of the sudden I felt an odd rumbling sensation in my abdomen.  Compelled by this strange feeling, I picked up my flashlight and looked around the local area. I found nothing, and I decided to go and sit down again. I sat there for the next 20 minutes,with a growing feeling of uncertainty and discontent washing over me. That's when it happened. The air around me grew very warm, a high pitched sound reached my ears.  Unsure of what was happening, I stood up.  A bright light, with a red tint to it surrounded me.  I felt myself loosing consciousness, and I fell to the ground. I drifted in and out of consciousness, each time I awoke, I remember seeing a bright light and blurry silhouettes all around me. The most apparent thing to me was that the figures were very short, no taller than a meter or so, and the table I was lying on was very close to the ground. I remember that occasionally the abductors would speak to each other, always in a high-pitched, rushed sort of way. Many hours later, I woke up. I was outside. I stood up, and I felt dizzy. Stumbling, I looked around the small clearing I was in. I finally found my tent, after walking around for nearly 15 minutes. I wasn't exactly sure of what happened. I packed up my tent, and other camping gear as fast as I could. I drove back to my house and went to bed. My dreams were disturbed with strange dreams of symbols I'd never seen before, as well as that same strange high-pitched noise I heard the previous night. Since then, I had a psychological evaluation done, and it came out completely fine. I am thoroughly convinced that I have come into contact with extra-terrestrials of some kind. Before that incident, I was like many people, a skeptic. I write this now as a believer, one who has experienced abduction, and has to live with it's horrible repercussions for the rest of my life.\",\n",
       "       \"close encounters several events 20 yrs apart Wish to remain anonymous.:  Please note this is strange enough for me to bring up.  Was ridiculed for it by my family for what I am about to write. I am of the age of 35 yrs and almost 20 yrs ago, a friend and I were honestly getting ready to head to the lakes about a mile from my home at the time to have a few beers.  Mind you we hadn't had any to drink at this point. We pulled up to about the end of the lake, “they were man made lakes for reservoirs,” and parked the car got out and cracked our first beer.  This was around 9:30 pm..  The year was I believe 1990 and it was around march , “what day I could not be sure,”.  Anyhow we just cracked our first beer and looked over to the north east toward cape Canaveral fl. We noticed a luminescent orange light emerging from the ground. Our first reaction was what is that?  I said it's the shuttle. My friend says , “no couldn't be I didn't hear anything on the news about a launch”. I said, “ Me either but there it is. The strange thing is that it looked to be traveling straight up and  at a very slow accent. My friend also noticed this and said that's weird. I agree. And sure as he said that it looked to have shot straight up what looked to be at least  2 miles up within the blink of an eye. We then noticed it coming in our direction. After seeing it move toward us we guessed it to be at least 3to4 miles away. It was over the lake not more than 50 yards in front of us within less than three seconds. Our initial reaction was holy sh** what the f**k is that. My friend and I got in the care shaking trying to put the keys in the ignition. I told him how many time in your life will you see this again? So we stayed. I remember it being shaped like a slender oval. It reflected the moonlight and the moon as would a mirror and had two lights on top swaying back and forth touching each other. No noticeable windows or anything. I don't think they knew we were there. I believe it was purely accidental we saw them that close because when I opened the car door to get a better look, “ this thing at an angle straightened up shot side to side across the lakes at what appeared to now be a white light. It shot back and forth within 2 seconds stopped  at the end of the lakes and just shot off towards west palm bch fl you didn't have time to even close your eye and it was gone. We both agreed that we had just seen what we had seen. I told him we should tell someone. He said sh** I'm not telling anyone there going to think your f***ing crazy. I went home told my mom and brother who both till this day call me a liar and just don't believe. Look I wasn't a believer in this. Never told stories like this in my whole life about seeing things. Yet how can you help what you see. I am now and always will be a believer. The story gets better. For about a week after I noticed what appeared to be a white light resembling a star would always be on the right of the cars I would be in and would also change direction with the car as we would turn there it would be on the right side of the car. Weird I thought at first until I thought that no other stars do that so what the f am I going crazy?  I kept telling my girlfriend at the time and she about thought I was going crazy too. Until about 6 days after the initial sighting I noticed from my house back by the lakes a light. Looked like a spot light from a helicopter. I told my girl do you see that? She said it's just a plane or something like that. So out of all last hope I grabbed my lighter , “I know sounds stupid,” and began flickering in click click click pause click pattern. My girl looked at me like I was crazy. Can you blame her. Everyone else thought I was crazy. Until I noticed the light got real bright and flickered the same pattern. My girl said that was co-incidence so I did it again in a different pattern. And once again it did also. At this point my girl even said that's weird. I noticed the light starting to come our direction and as it got closer we heard the sound of a prop plane. My girlfriend then said see I told you it was a plane and I said no crap your right. At this moment the prop plane sound changed to what sounded like a helicopter . I started to trip at this point and I asked my girl if she just heard that thing change sound. She said yes. And at that moment it sounded like it changed to the sound of a single jet propulsion engine. The light began to get closer and as it came by the street in front of the house the light dimmed out to almost nothing and the sound just stopped. And there it was again and my girl saw it with her own eyes and starting crying and saying I want to go inside. I told her to look and tell me I am not crazy and she said I see it I see it I want to go in the house. I told her to go inside and get my mom and her husband , “at the time,” and tell them to come out the back door and look up over the house in the back yard . This thing was 30 ft high and probably 30 ft in front of us. By the time my mom and her husband came out I watched this thing start flickering and moving up down left right and random patterns as fast as the eye could see and disappeared . My mother said that I talked about it so much to my girl that I convinced her to see this in living color and she saw it only because I convinced her to see this, my girl I mean. She even told my mother and they did not believe us. If I was that convincing to make someone see that then put me on ripleys or I am in the wrong line of work. Oh well I know what I saw and have not seen it in almost 20yrs. Moved to wis. And recently strange things have occurred over the last two weeks that I can not explain. White star like object sitting in the sky around dusk very similar to the one I thought was around for a week prior to the second sighting when I was sixteen. Noticed every night for last two weeks at least ten times this has occurred. Will watch the star slowly descend and turn to amber orb no visual shape other than amber or every once in a while it changes colors but mostly amber. Sits there and moves slow almost as if to get my attention. Will watch it fade out to nothing and light will reappear bright white and turn amber and move slightly . Call this strange but it is really weir-ding me out .   After 19 yrs what the hell is it and why does it keep coming back . Have looked around environment and questioning it you know , “ maybe it's a street light , but come up with the same answer. It's not! Reason: It has not been here every night.  I've seen this thing at least! 10 times and on a couple of clear nights its not there and 30min later there it is . So if anyone can help me solve this riddle pls do. Note: I have never been abducted nor have I ever seen an alien being, just what I saw when I  was sixteen and now again almost 20 yrs later. Have never been inside of this thing or anything like this. Just a color changing orb appears at close range. Is it possible after one has a close encounter for these things to show up and let you know at a distance that they are back or am I just fortunate enough to see this again ? And if so why ? Haven't seen or looked up in almost 20 yrs . Tried to forget what I saw. This all started 4/14/2010 right before the meteor event. Saw these lights before the meteor and have 9 other occasions over the last 2 weeks. I know I am not nuts considering I haven't seen this in 19 yrs and not the same. This has been appearing around9:30 10: almost every night for the last two weeks. Any explanation would be valued.

       "       \"Unbelievable Detailed Unknown Aircraft, seemed like it was about to land!   The time was around 8:30 p.m. The air craft was much too large, to be anything of this planet. It seemed to be only about 500 yards away, but from the size of the object, you were able to tell it was many miles away. It seemed to be hovering at a stillness I can't even describe. The details were more vivid of any photos I have yet to ever seen, I and others were even able to see windows on the air craft. It had many golden lights around it. If I were to try to look close enough, it was so detailed, if I gave an attempt maybe I could even see the objects inside the space craft. Nights prior to the evening my family had gotten weird phone calls (ones of which it would call the house with only a voicemail, and unusual sounds would be signaled on the other line), we called the Verizon network, they said what we were describing of the calls to be unnatural and unheard of.  That same night, I had a dream of being abducted, but that seems to be out of subject. No photos have been taken, unfortunately. It was a fast 2-3 minute sighting, and there was six witnesses. I was the one who spotted it, but anyone would of it was huge, not just a dot in the sky.  I and many people of the town or maybe the state saw it that night, but I guess I am the only one to report it so far. The object was in great detail, much of golden lights, windows, and even a disk like shape. This is not a lie; it is a reporting that should be known to all UFO investigators. Note:  When the object disappeared it seemed to disappear in a flash, but you heard the sound it made, very unusual sound, and it hurt the ear.  Also the stars seemed to separate and then come right back in to place. It&#8217;s really hard to describe, I wish you were to see it. An awesome sighting!\",\n",
       "       \"Two dull white lights moving in unison and redirecting  in tandem together as one large craft  500 Lights On Object0: Yes I wanted to report this sighting to you.As I feel it most important that others understand this is NOT a joke.I have witnessed something that today compells me to share these sightings in testimony to you and others who read this report.I have a lifetime belief that I'm under contact of higher intelligence/s-since childhood.I can only submitt data observed in truth without fear, but fascination to share.Here's what happened that early Morning, Aug.3rd,2002.I had awoken at my camp site.It was approximately, after 2:20am.I was still half asleep,dazed, finding myself awakening in the chair-dozed off.My campfire was out-all sound came from nature-ie Bull frogs/Crickets.After 11:00pm here,most of camp is asleep.Still dazed,I got up and looked up at clear night sky.The display of the many star constellations amazed me, that I don't see in the city.I went to my car to unlock the driver's door.I looked up near above and noticed a single dull white light moving across the sky, heading southward.Instantly realizing it was a jet and looked down again to focus.I then walked around to get some camp gear into the car.Within a minute,I again looked up and notice NOW.Two white dull lights following in unison close together trailing in tandem.I'm guessing hundreds of yards apart to even maybe half mile apart.These lights were high like a jet.Yet, I then noticed no sound coming from the aircraft high above.I though that is strange and ran to the picnic table for my flashlight.The speed of these lights seemed like a Cessna plane.Yet were quite high like a jet, at a high altitude.I signaled them with my high powered flashlight at each light 3-4 times on and off.I then turned flashlight beam in a clockwise motion at both lights 3-4 times.I just stood there looking at them moving across the sky together.After about 30-40 seconds.My spine rosed with a strange bizarre tingle up my neck hairs.Both lights together -redirected, direction together -westw! ard.They did not turn together in a turn, as they should have ! in turin g like conventional aircraft.I was in complete shock realizing that both lights could well be one large craft high above, monitoring down below over Lake Ontario.I felt like screaming to wake up camp of what I had just witnessed.The lights moved westward over Lake Ontario.Within another 20 seconds,I losted sight of them due to the mature tall trees blocking westward sky.After losing them,I thought it not a good idea to scream.I would be considered some type of nut-that earlier morning.Not a good idea ~* I calmed down.Still not believing what my eyes had just witnessed.Now I was fully awake and obsessed in skywatching until 3:30am-nothing more to see .Following the next night, my last night there at camp.I skywatched until 3:30am.I again observed nothing unusual.Following Saturday,on August 10th 2002. I found in the city Newspaper Insight \\\\Section.That on August 3rd,2002 in the early morning.Farmers in Howick ,Quebec found strange crop circles.The formation being called a Qua! druple formation.It now confirmed to me of what I had witnessed that same morning on Aug.3rd 2002.There was a something intelligent and large over the skies in southern Ontario/Quebec that early morning to confirm.Just to note some other strange observations on the ground here at the time during camp Peter.My car clock was 13 minutes slower.Earlier in the week at camp.I heard strange animal sounds near 1:30am.I have never heard these sounds before-high pitched squeaking.Even a cottager across the river shone their high beam flashlight at the strange sound's location described.Here's the kicker to this story of paranormal.My 9 year old son said he saw a Koala Bear in the day.It was the same area as the shrinking that late night.He knows his animals-so what was it ?? The day I came home at camp.Near midnight, when I went to bed.I could hear this same type of sound I heard at camp, now here at home.My body felt highly electrified.Like all my body hair stood up ^ . I was so tired from the late nights before .Previous to 2002,I have witnes! sed othe r aerial anomalies at camp since 1999.It was this sighting and experience that sparked my interest to research and understand.What's going on here ? I feel it possible that I have been abducted numerous times-since childhood.It's almost like it follows you.I do believe this is a life time conditioning.Making it easier to except a intelligent presence around us.Lessening the fright factor.I will include the newspaper article concerning the crop circle formations found in Howick Quebec.Thx again PMS ((NUFORC Note:  One of several reports submitted by same source.

       "       'i saw a ufo land and aliens come out   Hello, It\\'s 5/24/10 my name is ((name deleted)). I\\'m 26 year\\'s old with two little girls.... I don\\'t really know who to tell my story to. I\\'ve had these strange sorts of events happening to me throughout my life.  They were coupled with different feelings... confusion, fear, disbelief. None of it really made sense until I saw in detail what I\\'m about to tell you.  I knew that everything I had questioned before was no longer questionable.  It was undisputed in my mind.  It has been going on my entire life and now there is finally an event that proves (to me) that this is real. I\\'ll start by telling you that my cousin ((name deleted)) was with me when this happened...  He has been in the navy now for about 8 years.  He is a trustworthy person and his word means a lot to everyone that knows him.  Not only is it me telling the story, but he can verify that what I\\'m telling you is true. My cousin and myself were sitting on the back porch of my house (which was also my bedroom).  It was my bedroom at the time because it was a room enclosed with glass walls.  Some of the sections of the glass had been removed and either had screens remaining or nothing left in them at all.  Since it was summer, this wasn\\'t really a problem.  I actually loved being in a room that allowed me to look outside at nature and even the stars. We had a couch-bed in the room that was unfolded at the time.  It was unfolded for most of the summer so that my cousin could sleep over and \"hang out\" with me.  The backside of the couch-bed was placed against the glass, so the unfolded bed occupied the space in the room facing the house. We were laying in bed trying to sleep but we spent most of our time talking instead.  Then, out of the corner of my eye, I spotted a red glowing orb that came into view from behind the house and was slowly moving across the sky.  *See Attached Photo*  I got ((name deleted)) attention and we both watched the orb move across the treeline that was north of the trailer park.  It seemed to not be as far away as a plane should be.  It look to be about the size of a basketball approximately 50 yards away.  I then realized that it was getting closer and that it clearly was not a plane. As it moved across the sky, we watched as this incredible UFO was slowly moving toward a treeline where we assumed it would disappear out of our lives forever. But instead of disappearing into the sky... I could still see it through the trees moving towards the ground. I could clearly see it flickering through the trees and I would estimate it to be approximately 10 feet off of the ground as it entered the field on the left.  It had clearly made a 90 degree turn. At this point in time I realized that it was probably in the field that was on the other side of the treeline.  (Treeline: small patch of woods separating the trailer park and a field.)  It traveled the length of the field before I could not see it through the trees anymore.  I would estimate the length of the field to be about 200 yards. My cousin and myself sat in awe even after we could not see the UFO anymore.  He turned to me and said \"let\\'s go check it out!\"  I sternly answered with, \"hell no! are you f**king crazy??\"  I was not sure what I had just seen but I had a gut feeling that I did not want to find out. So, we waited...waited... two young boys waiting to see something else as amazing as what they had just witnessed. Then it happened... A flash, as if someone had taken a picture from a camera, appeared at my friend ((name deleted)) trailer.  It was on the other side of her trailer, preventing me from seeing the source of the flash. Approximately two minutes later, another flash... this time, from the side of her trailer. I still couldn\\'t clearly see the source of the flash. At this point, my cousin and I were starting to think something strange was happening. A few moments later, another flash. This time, I could clearly see the source of the flash... nothing.  It appeared as if the flash was angled towards ((name deleted)) house, although there was no source of the flash.  There was absolutely nothing visible to the naked eye that created this OBVIOUS flash.  Bud and myself both KNEW that flashes that are that distinct do NOT come from NOTHING. We waited about five more minutes still staring out into the trailer court through my glass room.  We were now more worried about what was in the court than what we had seen earlier.  Without speaking to each other for what seemed like five or ten minutes, another flash happened. This time it was at my friend ((name deleted)) house - directly in front of my house.  The flash was on the other side of the trailer and appeared to be aimed at his mothers bedroom.  Again we waited... wondering what the flashes were. Another couple minutes had gone by.  Another flash. This time, it was clearly pointed at Tommy\\'s window and there was NOTHING at the source of the flash.  In my mind I could pinpoint, to the INCH, where the flash had started, yet there was nothing there. ((name deleted)) looked to me and said,  \"what the hell are those flashes?\"  I had no reply.  I wanted to remain silent and hidden from whatever had been making the flashes. Again we waited. About another five minutes passed when there was a flash on the other side of Mr. Wilson\\'s house.  (That wasn\\'t his real name, but we knew him as Mr. Wilson in the trailer park.)  So, we waited what seemed like forever.  In reality, it was probably 15 to 20 minutes with no sign of flashes or anything similar to them. Quite suddenly, Bud looked at me and said \"well, I\\'m getting tired. wake me if anything happens.\"  He then put his head right down on his hands where he was sitting (propped up on his knees on the backside of the couch bed). I said, \"okay\" but wondered how anybody in their right mind could just fall asleep that fast after witnessing what we had witnessed. In my mind,  I would not go to sleep until the sun was up and people were awake. I started to get the strange feeling that the happening wasn\\'t over.  Then... I started piecing things together that were quite simple and obvious. 1. ((name deleted)) lives with her mother and father.  There were 3 flashes at her trailer. (aimed at their bedrooms… )  2. ((name deleted)) lives with his mother. There were 2 flashes at his trailer. (aimed at their bedrooms, also...)  3. Mr. ((name deleted)) lives alone. There was one flash. I figured that if they had gone through flashing every individual, as they went around from left to right in the court, since Wilson was last they had to turn around and come up the other line of trailers...starting with mine. I almost panicked as I came to the realization of what I believed was true. I turned my head in the direction of where I believed the thing causing the flash to be.  As I turned my head I could clearly see out my window (one that did not have glass or screen in it - open - nothing obstructing my view) an alien.  I had turned quick enough to spot him before I saw a flash come from, what seemed like, his forehead.......... When the flash hit me, he disappeared and I realized I was completely paralyzed.  As I tried to move my limbs, I looked around to realize that I was no longer on the same part of my bed that I had been during the flash.  I was, in fact, at the foot of my bed on my knees staring at the open window as if nothing had happened. Instantly, the numbness was gone. I grabbed the back of Bud\\'s leg (because he was in the same position that he had been in when he laid his head down...)  It appeared that he had not moved at all.  But somehow I was at least 4 feet away from where I was when I had seen the flash...?  When I grabbed his leg I screamed extremely loud \"BUD! wake up!\"  His head came off of his hands with his eyes wide as if he knew something wasn\\'t right. We didn\\'t have to say anything to each other as we both jumped up and ran into the kitchen.  We each armed ourselves with butcher knives, not knowing how much time had gone by or if the threat was still around. He asked me what had happened.  The only way I could really describe it to him was \"I was flashed..\"  Bud KNEW what I meant by that, which told me that I wasn\\'t just seeing things and that I wasn\\'t alone. After about two minutes of silence.. waiting for something else to happen.. we finally laughed at the fact that we were standing armed in the kitchen with knives... waiting for aliens to come. It seemed ridiculous to us.  Although it had clearly just happened, we couldn\\'t really wrap our minds around it.  So, we laughed it off and this time we went to bed INSIDE of the house, instead of the room surrounded with glass windows. (This event has made me realize that more than one time in my life - for a split second - I have seen aliens and \"the flash\". I have seen them in my bedroom window... I have seen them outside of my tent while sleeping in the woods* the same woods that are between the trailer park and the field I described*... I have had many occasions where, just for a second, I believed that I had been part of an alien abduction. Seeing what I have seen and the fact that I have witnessed a UFO, I have seen that UFO land in my field, I have seen something flash friends and neighbors, and I have been flashed by something that came from the sky... this is not your ordinary alien story because to this day I cannot say that I fully remember ever communicating with an alien or being aboard their \"crafts\". But that doesn\\'t mean that I haven\\'t seen, felt, or experienced something extremely out of the ordinary. My cousin was there as a witness to the UFO and to all six flashes... (the seventh, of co! urse, being my own) I have no explanation as to WHAT exactly the flashes are or WHAT they do to people, but I do think that they were meant for individual people... and to somehow make a person \"unaware\" that something is going on... whether by putting them to sleep... paralyzing them... or wiping out their memory... I don\\'t know for certain. What I do know for certain is that I have had many encounters with them and I believe that I truly know how they arrive. To put it bluntly, I\\'ve caught them in the act of flashing people. I believe that they were completely unaware that I had spotted them, until it was too late. I feel as though they knew that they had made a mistake. I had witnessed their mistake and I almost FELT the reaction of the alien as.. panic. For the instant that I saw him, I knew in my gut that he was as scared of me as I was of him. I knew that their \"routine\" was not supposed to have been witnessed by anyone. We are supposed to be dazed and unaware by the ! flash when they come.) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))',\n",
       "       \"Prospecting for gold in california but found a UFO, or they found us  500 Lights On Object0: Yes Wife and I went gold prospecting near Mamouth Pools california. We were rigged up to stay for 2 weeks, the first night we saw a bright disk over the tree tops and it came over our tent about 125 feet above, it looked to be about 50 feet across, then it emited a bright light like a search light on our tent and my wife and I became unconcious and did not wake untill late the next morning. We asked each other if we were alright then talked about the sighting for a while. Then we went on about our prospecting. The next night it happened again the same way, and again we passed out when the bright light hit us. We reported the sighting to a few organizations, but Mufon was complete in their research, they used regression hypnoses on us in 2 visits to our house, and discovered that we had been abducted 2 times in 2 days. My reason for this letter is, Mufon does not want to risk sending anyone to this location  to investigate the sighting, and i feal that if someone investigates this sighting they will have positive proof of UFO's and EBE's   My full report of the sighting is on the MUFON website ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

       "       'I clearly saw a triangle craft that glided overhead and changed the electricity of the air, but it was hard to focus on. I was walking down the bike path when it was dark out, I was going down to the Dairy Queen to meet a friend, my ride.  On my way to the path, I saw something strange moving through the air, I could barely tell what it was and I incorrectly (or maybe correctly) thought I saw a UFO. I concluded that it was just a plane but there were more lights in the sky around. I\\'m about 45 min from Ohare so I know that my area has some looparound flight paths near it, and there seemed to be a ton of planes circling, you could almost always see one or two along a path at any given time or place (even later at the coffee shop many miles away there were still planes everywhere in the sky.)  There may be some back up because of the weather, it seemed like a storm is brewing in the air.  But on my way down the path, I saw another light in the distance, in a different direction that seemed... out of place. Once I got to where I could see clearly, it already had enough time to leave! . I kept on walking and about five minutes later I felt something change in the air. It was like the atmosphere had changed yet I was not consciously aware of it yet. It was more like instinct that made me turn my head, and I\\'m glad I did. I saw something strange looking come out of the area behind me and to my left. It was a collection of three lights and one blinking one. I would have thought it was another plane except it seemed different, something felt wrong about it. As it passed over me, it took about 15-25 sec to pass from the horizon to my back left to the front right, I saw what it was. It was very hard to focus on it or to look at what it was. It felt like, consciously, I could only observe my surroundings instead of rationally comprehend or pick apart details. I know what I saw but it was hard to get anything to register, I couldn\\'t pick it apart like I could shapes in a cloud. It was hard to see but it was only a few hundred feet above me, it was triangular and! had large lobed sides. It seemed outlined in something glowin! g white or translucent but shrouded as to not be too showy. As it passed I could see that there was something on the bottom, I\\'m not sure if it was energy pads or whatever that was the light, but I could tell it was not an airplane, it was low enough to see, but still high up. The memory is a little hard to remember of how exactly it looked, like I said, it seemed hard to focus on. As it was going into the distance I noticed it was in a new shape. The triangle seemed to turn into a T shape of disconnected lights but I never saw he conversion, only before and after. That may have been due to distance, but I do have pretty good eyesight and don\\'t often make up shapes like that. As it passed a few hundred feet over me, it wasn\\'t loud. It sounded like it was a jet that was much much further up, but even that sound seemed... artificial. As if it was something that would not be noticed in the background of air traffic noise, but when looked at sounded... off. And the object was much too c! lose to have normally been that quiet, if a jet was that low, car alarms would be going off and the ground rumbling. As it glided over me, for I was in the center of a very small village with noone else around as far as I could see, the hum of the electricity seemed to temporarily change. I don\\'t remember if the frequencies got higher or lower but I remember hearing a distinct change that only happened as it was passing over the building that had neon signs. What\\'s odd is that I tried to tell the friends I hung out with multiple times about the sighting but no matter how hard I tried, the conversation would always get wildly diverted. I tried, but I couldn\\'t slip it in in the few hours we were at Caribou Coffee. Even when I would do my best to specifically bring it up, the person I was trying to tell, the UFO junkie, kept suddenly getting compelled to finish a thought from 20, 30 minutes earlier in conversation. I could get not get a word about that in edgewise, even though! if I blatantly said I saw a UFO we would have been talking ab! out it a ll night. As I walked home from Denny\\'s (yes, too many different restaurants,) about a good mile from home and at the top of a hill next to which is my house in the expansive valley below it, I could see helicopters everywhere. Even If I couldn\\'t see bright lights like I could from some of them, there was always one around. I would look into the sky and see a flash of some helicopter or something very far off, an impossible distance to identify what, but it was the artificial flash of a helicopter. They were everywhere. Cops too were hurriedly congregating, I saw three suddenly rush into a meeting place and I was walking across the street from the storage facility they met at. They got out of their cars and talked about \"I saw blah\" \"It was seen\" \"blah blah seen.\" I  couldn\\'t really make out what they were saying, but they were all sharing about something they saw. It may have been in relation to a criminal act, but events were weird as is. (What\\'s weird is that the UFO remi! nded me of a dream I had a while back about UFOs. I almost never have dreams about them and I know that it wasn\\'t a real abduction, just my unconscious playing around, but it still looked similar to my abduction dream.) Oh yeah, plus there were a ton of other aircraft around, but this glided by pretty quickly and in it\\'s own direction, not one that is a flight path. It was foggy and hazy tonight everywhere, but this was mostly below the clouds.',\n",
       "       \"Life changing mind blowing unreal to much for 1 person3  500 Lights On Object0: Yes UFO sightings saw 2 smaller orb like objects that circle each other then try to blend in sky like stars for 30 to 45 minutes as soon as the first couple stars are in the sky the orbs would do a little circle routine or hover aimlessly within a mile or 2 radius of house at about 35 to 50 thousand ft also 2 bigger UFO's with red/white lights at least 35ft each possibly bigger. 1 moved a lot possibly landed about half a mile from my place or someone was messing with me my guess is NOT But it looked like it was just hovering above the ground could not have been no more than 6 to 10ft .Tried to take picture but my camera couldn't capture image. Glowing orb sightings occurred April 16-22 of 2009 the other 2 bigger ships showed the 16th and 17th only the one big ship returned April 19-22 but here is the best part on 4/21 between 12 o clock and 1 o clock at night I was actually getting very scared had no car or phone to get the hell out of dodge and I herd a jet so ran on the porch to see what was about to happen and thought I was gonna see something really cool  ha!! Nope the jet flying between 10 maybe 15 thousand ft. flew directly over the house with his burners on and a maybe a mile or 2 away was the UFO  the jet just flew by or just didn't see it either way I felt a little less worried because I thought somebody finally made the call it did take of about 30 seconds later or I thought that just a cloud covering it without the cloud.Me being irrational with the reality of the situation ran to the middle of the driveway with my binoculars I noticed this pain in the back of my head that me and my mother had felt on 16th but she was to freaked out by the whole idea and actually said she was scared she was gonna get picked up and dropped of ha!! so most every night I got my binoculars and watched the orbs circling each other but they came a little earlier each night the 2 orbs were never out with the other 2 UFOs that i could see they always came before the UFOs with red/white light's.Also I'm 10! 0% sure they were not airplanes because most of the time I would be watching the UFOs and planes would go by. Also that area is flooded with air traffic day and night but those first 2 nights there was so many airplane there was at least 1 or more in my sight at all times and no noise at all from the orbs and flight characteristics matched none of today's jets/plains/helicopter hovered like a balloon but picked up to much speed to fast.It was not shooting stars very simple very clear. I also know a few people who live in that area a good chunk of their life who have witnessed UFO activity in the area years ago.These were not my first sightings in the area 2 times before to be exact witch leads me to my next words. 2 people told me they saw a UFO years earlier in the area.I look at the stars since the dish got cut off about a month ago I would not have saw any of it if i had not talked to my grandmother that day .At first it when the orbs arrived I could not be drag in the house all I wanted to do was get that awesome footage and watch it over every night.But each night was a little different but on the 4th day I was doing a lot of thinking and was also filled with excitement fear I just wasn't thinking strait.I would sometimes turn on the porch light before I would go outside or to let dogs in and out so eventually  what ever was flying those aircraft had to see me turning on the porch light the UFO,s returned every night for something they would hover for hours some nights so when they stopped in the sky right in front of the house and they got a little closer as they were circling and dropping altitude slowly closer towards the ground.They knew I was there I just didn't really think about it until the orbs chilled in the air for a couple hours and it was still 4/20 about 10 o clock to top it all of I was by my myself no running vehicle and I finally realized if they/it whatever could build aircraft such as the ones they/it/him/her what ever posses they probably have technology or something that lets them know ! I'm ther e. I ignored my worst fears and the hurt in my head to see if the other 1or 2 UFO,s were doing their thing about a mile or so away the fear is the 2 orbs froze in the sky circling away.I tried to take more pictures worthless attempts the camera sucks so it was another fail.So I sat on the porch looking at the sky above a airplane was passing and a really bright light caught my eye from strait above it was the second UFO from the mountain it's lights shined bright white ember and red  for about 5 seconds then quickly cut of its lights. After that my brain couldn't let me watch any more i had seen to much it could have been right above me the entire time it had demonstrated it's superior capabilities. I couldn't take it I came close to calling the 5-0 to do what.But at 12:32 4/21 I heard the jet and I couldn't help to think what if those where aliens that would mean that this planet could be taken if so pleased seeing demonstrations 1 after another. now for but I know the Crafts could have returned again last night i could not tell you yes or no because i was typing this. I can take a chance and look like a fool or do NOTHING.  4/25/09   pss i wrote this on the 4/24 and 25th and i returned to my house at about 8 or 9 on the night of the 25th and the UFOs did return again about it seen much more UFO activity last night more than what is normally out actually.Not sure all how many or if any other people in the area know about the UFO  activity in the area . But I checked online to see if any UFO had been reported in the area  but nothing has ever been reported in that area till now.But i heard some people on a plane over North Carolina seen UFO in Feb i really wouldn't doubt it  or just t don't care.4/27/09 Saw 3 UFO's within 1 hour. I only watched for a hour or so then retired for the night.  4/28/09 OK this time i saw 3 UFO's circling near an airplane was pretty close to the 3 orbs glowing a ember or copper color . I honestly would not be surprised if people or pilots do not report seeing them.Also 3 extra! UFO's i n where in the sky last night. and I also seen the shape of UFO that was a  triangle it had 6 lights that shined a bright white and I now think it was one like the triangle UFO that landed or just hovered over neighbors yard but to be honest I don't really know the shape of the craft that hovered over the neighbors yard but because I took 6 pictures on the 16th and looked at them on my computer the 17th no good except for I could see something in 1 picture that was above the ground that looked like a silver line but thought nothing of it and deleted it because I thought it was just camera error and another pic with bubble light if that makes since looked like bubbles that were lite up from the inside out all over the picture and i didn't even mean to take a picture I turned around to go on the porch after many failed pictures and it just took a pic but now it would make since because I thought that was 1 of the 2 with the red and white lights I just couldn't say because I only seen the lights on them but now I'm 50% sure that the 2 with the red and white lights were triangle while the other 2 were orb shaped but only from a distance I am still not sure of their  true shape yet but i will try to find out.I've also seen more UFO's but these that i have written about have always came back and hang around in the area for hours or a few minutes at a  time. sometimes they leave and return the same night but there are also many others but are just passing through the area  i do know is that there is a air base or something around  4/29/09 also sorry for not sending this sooner but this is one of the biggest decision of my life and  i fear you guys will come to check it out and the UFO's will have left the area and I will look like A dumb ass.Just contact me by email if you have any questions.1 Last thing i have not really left any specific time records for sightings well I also didn't keep count but if i did it be about 30 just since April 16/09 and i would be happy to take a lie detector test if needed you can! imagine that i am very confused with what I am seeing and for a while after i seen my first real UFO right by house about 200ft in the air and the craft was at least 60ft to 70ft I was beyond petrified and terrorfied my mom was in the next room so I holler to show her and it was moving at about 30mph we got out on the porch and it was going right over the tree line at a near by mountain with only 1 dim white light on and i started turning the flash light on and off and it brighten it's light and froze in mid air over the mountain for a couple of seconds then faded from sight as it hovered the mountain I thought i was hallucinating basically I thought i was going insane my mom saw it to or she says she did.The 2nd time I was at the end of the driveway using the cell phone and this time I was alone but I was talking to somebody who I couldn't exactly tell there is a UFO and the front is visible and the rest is like not there.The guy would have laughed hung up and had me in a padded room within the hour plus I didn't tell anyone mainly because nobody could believe this anyway. So I thought to my self ? there was a front and it was black I thought it was some birds flying in like a formation but first of all it was to even if birds are flying that close together there is gonna be some birds getting ahead even 1ft  movement in fly formation it would look squiggly and no wings flapping and no space between the wings of the birds that's when I started thinking great another UFO maybe I'm not crazy.It was also like 6oclock day time sunny not dark at all.It was only about 100yards in the air and it was moving to slow to some birds flying and I couldn't think of anything else that even looks like that did and still cant.I can only say the front was shaped like an ark it was black and if this was a UFO it was about 120ft wide at least and the rest wasn't even visible I'M not sure why all of this shit is all within 3mile radios of the house.At first i thought they had their own private base somewhere in the mountains that ! was my o wn little crap theory so I remembered the direction the 1st UFO was headed then the 2nd then i figured out if there was a base I got the general direction it might be in but here is the interesting part there is a water fall in the direction I figured the base would be not a base but a person i know and his friend saw a UFO up at the water fall years ago.Another person i know said he saw one out the house window. saw diamond shaped UFO same kind I had seen at my old  house but in a different place 2 times and to top it all of A jet was chasing a UFO right above my head at about 20 to 35 thousand ft. I was gonna send a email to Ktox to show UFO hunters in April but to much pressure and I was moving so instead I just let it eat at my soul if i ever had one. I will fill out a crap report that people will laugh at anyway but if my best friend told me this shit I would have called the nut hut. I also found out that during the days of my April 16th/25th UFO sighting people all over the planet were witnessing the strange crafts I even watched a video of  2 orbs in a different place i didn't really expect that A month later but its crazy. also many left out details and UFO sightings.also temperarly disabled the DVD player with fuzzy black and white picture kinda twisted blackness on 4/20 weak also had 2 pretty weird dreams during those nights maybe caused by stress and fear. Also i forgot to mention April/16/09 I called my friend then called my grandma that lives in Delaware for the first time in 2 years i call her and talk till cell phone goes dead then charge up and go back to the end of the drive way to get cell phone reception.Anyway I didn't tell here about my second UFO sighting just my first and she told me her and her daughter saw 2 orb shaped UFO's that were as she describes circling each other kinda like they were just playing with each other so I was starting to feel not as insane after she told me that but she didn't know how twisted my mind was from the my 2nd sighting and we started discussing how we think the world is failing I said [to be completely honest i don't think the world is gonna make it to long at the rate its going and humanity will eventually kill itself with the pride in the nations starting pride wars  they wont just unit as people and just get it over with and start the road to mega science and eventually humans leave earth to go explore the universe] And she was saying now days it's scary to even consider having  a kid in the world today and I was standing by the mail box and it was starting to get dark but I was just looking up in the sky and i saw i just waited about 5 seconds to think see holy shit mum mum there are 2 orbs just circling each other just like mum mum said like 10 minutes earlier my mind was bent way to far then so i ran in the house got my mom and they were gone I knew then I had lost my fuckin mind i told mum mum they were gone and nobody seen them once again then I told her about my second siting and how crazy I am because i COULD HAVE SWORN i JUST SAW THEM 2 UFOs i said then she says your not crazy and if they just poped up from the sky they will be back I started telling her no they won't because I'm just crazy but i waited a couple minutes and told her that's the biggest coincidence of my life but still not sure of reality untill the orbs show up again I got my moms and her boyfriend to check it out and sure enough they ! were rea l I wasn't crazy my mind untied for the moment just untill the 2 bigger UFOs were chillin over a mountain till later then me and my mom was trying to take the pictures of them in the sky then 1 of the UFOs flew over a mountain it was amazing to even be able to watch it just move at all to even see the damn thing then lights were flashing near the ground I knew if i didn't say anything just give it 10 seconds max and my mom said do yo see that light on the ground she say what the hell is that I was still focused on the other UFO in the sky mainly the lights because they were flashing the same colors and it wasn't the neighbors TV on in the camper.Looking at it threw the binoculars was making my heart speed and hands shake and could see the light on very clear as they flashed different colors purple red blue green i don't remember all the colors but at some point a truck went by maybe 100 to 125ft from the object from the road it lasted about 30 minutes and only got weirder as the lights in the sky were synchronized flashing of colors with those just of the craft that just hovered over the ground a quarter mile away then gone like nothing but it was back over a mountain after that mom wouldn't even go to check out the UFOs with me any other night except 1 more time to see a triangle UFO crawl across the sky and when it went over the mountain she was back in the house she missed the best part after a couple minutes passed the bright white light on the craft looked awesome as it went to fast for my guesses i just know it picked up and haled ass out of that valley and her boyfriend just wants nothing to do with any of that but now he is all about some gay brown mountain lights or something i told him this is maybe once in a lifetime thing you might never see anything this amazing ever again he didn't even respond.these events took place on April/16-17/2009 believe it or not this shit happened and still is happening all over the world is my guess it doesn't just happen near my house and my neighbors front yard! ...1 mor e thing I had a dream and all I really remember is seeing the alien face as i lay on a table or something and it was over me then i woke up and my right eye was twitching really bad I don't think it was an abduction more like fear and stress and some other issues coming out but the other dream well may have been a abduction because I've never felt like i'm awake with my eyes closed but couldn't move I felt paralyzed I knew I wanted my eyes open but I just lay there and I don't know how long but when i finally came to i knew that has never happened and i felt like I was floating and then i felt the couch i was sleeping on touching me and time could not even be measured in the stat i was in I felt violated with life and still do i haven't called any of my friends or spoke to my granny since 4/17/09 and every minute of every day most all day till i go to sleep than wake up with it on my mind it never goes away and not showing my friends was a mistake but what if they got abducted then how would i feel because when i would see UFOs I would give em the finger I used to say if i ever see A UFO I'm gonna shoot at it.THESE ARE THE MOST OUTRAGES CLAIMS YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD well i don't care because every word of it is true.\",\n",
       "       \"On Monday, May 17, 2010, at 22:00 my friend and I were in cherry creek state park when we noticed 3 lights travelling from north to south at very high altitude.  They appeared to do tight zig zag's once in a while and on one occasion, stopped completely and the lights went out. then we noticed a fighter jet pass by, after that the lights reappeared and seemed to be chasing the jet.   Earlier in the night we also saw a triangle do a u-turn right over our heads without a single trace of noise.  Its the first time I've been literally afraid of being abducted.

       "       '2 Teardrop shaped crafts sighted, one followed us down the mountain My girlfriend and I left my mother’s house around 10:20pm on Monday night. She lives on a mountain with lots of pasture and trees. We started driving down the mountain when we passed a car on a very big curve. There was a large break in the trees, and that is when we saw the UFO. It was approximately 400ft above the tree line and approximately 100ft in front of us. I was trying to make sure it was infact a UFO and not a plane, so I unconsciously started slowing down and stopped while we were staring and discussing its shape. It appeared to be rather stationary at that time. It had three bright lights we could clearly see, which seemed to give it a circular or teardrop shape. As we were talking it started moving more in our direction. It moved at an angle, getting closer to both the ground and our position simultaneously. At which point my girlfriend tells me I need to start driving again since she doesn\\'t want to get abducted. It was like I was in a trance a! nd unable to move at first. After a short period of time I just snapped out of it and drove as fast as I thought I could without wrecking the car. I felt the only chance we had at it leaving us alone was making it to the nearby highway. She continued watching the craft from the window of the car while I drove. She noted it changing direction and following us. It was practically on top of us when we made it to the highway. We both lost sight of it for a short period as we continued driving down the highway.  Then we started seeing it sporadically through the trees to our left.  It seemed to be continuing in the same direction we were driving.  We decided to pull over and observe the UFO. This time it we did not feel threatened as it was much farther away from us.  When we caught sight of it again it was extremely high in the sky. Now we were able to see a blinking red light on another side of the craft. At first I thought perhaps it was a plane and we had really lost sight of the UFO. At this point it started descending. It was coming down in kind of steps. It would drop straight down and hover then drop again. This is when my girlfriend noticed the problem. That wasn\\'t our UFO at all. It was a second one.  We saw the craft that had been following us moving extremely low to the tree line, almost in the trees. We could see both the bright white lights and the flashing red one on the UFO now. It was obvious the two UFO’s were the same type of craft. They were moving towards each other. The lower one was practically underneath the higher one. Then it seemed as though the lower one turned. All we could see of it was the flashing red light. I started wondering what made it turn and if it was coming in our direction. I was keeping an eye on them and the fact there wasn\\'t nearly as much traffic on this highway as I\\'d like. Infact, at that moment there was no one to be seen. Then she uttered the worst words I\\'ve ever heard, \"Did you see that, over in the trees?\"  I glanced over to see what she was talking about. To the left, directly across the 4-lane, in the trees we saw two tiny light blue blinking \"lights\" next to each other in a straight line. The way they were positioned so close to each other made me think of eyes, though I do not know if that is what they were. They were too high to be the eyes of any animal I know of in the area. There were no buildings and no people in the area either. They also were not responding like an animals eyes. They were actually blinking, like twinkle lights on a fade switch. There was no light pointed in that direction for anything to be reflecting. There was nothing but darkness and our car lights pointing directly in front of us. My girlfriend told me she\\'d seen it blink at least five times before saying mentioning it.

       "       'I saw a big tilted dark gray saucer-like object moving slowly in the night sky. The object I saw was a very dark gray, saucer-like object that was tilted moving slowly to the right in the sky (roughly 500+ feet up). It was a bit more jagged than the normal “saucer” with a slight rectangle/diamond design. There were no lights of any kind on the object but there was a slight haze around the entire thing. I watched it hover in the sky, for roughly 3-5 mins before I completely lost track of it.  I don’t drink, smoke, do drugs, take any medication, and I don’t wear glasses or contacts. While I do believe in \"other\" life forms out in space, I’m not one to believe UFO sightings or abductions. There were trees in my view but the object was above them so they didn’t cause any problems. This event did happen at night around 11:30PM but I was wide awake.  I’m honestly blown away by what I witnessed tonight; I couldn’t believe my eyes when I saw. I’m not normally one to jump to conclusions or anything but I felt it deep within me that this was not a normal aircraft. I still can’t believe I actually witness this event, whenever anyone asks me about ghosts, etc. I tell them, I believe they MIGHT exist but I will never say they do till I witness it for myself. Well tonight, I witnessed a UFO sighting.',\n",
       "       'I saw a red and white flashing object that moved in any way other than a straight line, and I think it noticed me. Before I tell you what I saw, or what, at least, that I can remember of what I saw on May 27th, 2010, a short while after 10:00 p.m, latest being 10:20 p.m., I want to let you know that until recently I was a total skeptic.  Before all this chit-chat about ancient aliens and ufos started on t.v. and what not, I thought, \"Okay, well, I agree that it\\'s a possibility that there are other life forms out there, but I disagree that they have visited us.\"  Then came all the ufo hunters and t.v. series that have sparked an intriguement inside me. So, now let me describe my sighting to you. Okay, I\\'m walking my boyfriend to the top of my street from where he will skateboard home, we say our goodbyes and depart.  About this time everything is seemingly normal.  As I\\'m walking, being a nature lover that I am, I\\'m looking towards the sky.  And I thought, \"Wouldn\\'t it be crazy if I saw a ufo tonight? Walking home and I see one, yea right hahah\" sort of joking about in my head. Well, a few minutes later I notice something that first I thought was a star.  However, it had a white and red flashing light system.  The object would glow a dim red, and then a bright white, and then back to the dim red and then back to the bright white, like a strobe light, then I thought that\\'s strange, so I stopped walking.  And that\\'s when I noticed that this object was moving in abrupt directions, such as zig zagging, but this object was very far away so I could only see it move just a little bit everytime it did so. It was only a little light in the sky flashing a dim red and then a brighter white and moving in every other way I can think of asides a straight line.  Okay, here\\'s where things get even a little more funky, so I\\'ve stopped and I\\'m looking at this light in the sky and I think \"Oh well, there must be some logical explanation for it.\"  So I keep walking, not a block away from my apartment, I turn my head to face in front of me and I noticed that far away up in the sky, is ANOTHER one of these flashing lights, still red and white, so I look back at the spot that my eyes had just previously left and sure enough the same one is still there.  I felt a bit frightened at this point and hurried into my home through the back door because I felt that it hid the view from those points of mysterious light, from what might\\'ve been aliens.  Now there is one critical detail that I have left out, and that is that while I was walking, the light that I was watching, moved from in front of me ! to behind me.  It was originally ahead of me and off to my right, then it moved to behind me and off to my right, had I turned around and faced it, it would have been on my left.  I cannot explain it any better than that. In one or two sentences, I was walking home the other night and noticed two objects that were distant from each other in the sky yet had the same flight patterns and dual red/whtie light systems that were definitively not airplanes and not helicopters.  There was no sound, it was as simple as this, when I laid my eyes on it I knew it was something I had never seen before, and it frightened me.  I\\'ve seen video recordings of such orbs of changing light and the best way I can tell you what it was, is a red and white ufo like all the other ufos glowing a bright white light and some other color.  I\\'m saying that it is a possible UFO abduction case because soon after I went to bed, they might\\'ve beamed me up late at night.  Also my boyfriend had a dream about me being abducted by aliens.  And when I think back to that night, things always get a little blurry, and everything that I said to you I remember with specific detail.  When it comes down to it, I think I might propose that! aliens are trying to make me forget, but I\\'m holding onto it, almost like when you try to remember what you dreamed last night, and you can remember those bits and pieces of imagery but not the whole scenario.',\n",

       "       '2 UFO\\'s sighted over Leeds UK. At around 21:00 on 01/03/09 while driving up Ramshead Drive from Northpark way Leeds 14 with my partner and our daughter, I observed to the west a very bright stationary object, which immediately drew my attention as being \"not normal\" and so I pulled over in the road to observe it. From where we stopped we had a very clear view over the city center to the south west, and just over to the west was this stationary bright white object hovering around I would say 1000 feet or less. It was what looked to be pulsating in size and changing colour from brilliant white to red over in cycles. My partner being very skepticle about these kinds of things, struck me as unusual as she was very excited at what we were observing. Both myself and my father have a very keen interest in the UFO abduction phenomenon and so at this point I phoned my father to tell him about what I was observing. Only to have the phone answered by a very excited tone saying how he had too seen the objects and was observing \"them\" with my mother and brother in the sky to the west. At this point being very confused about them seeing more than one object, a red object of slightly smaller size appeared in the sky at a much lower altitude to the first, but pulsating hovering around i would say 500 feet. I am training to be a pilot and so I feel I have an accurate knowlege on jusging this height. At this point around 21:10 an airliner approaching from the south decending into Leeds Bradford Airport (at which may I point out was a Jet2 boeing 737 LS348 from Dusseldorf, and must have also viewed these objects) passed between them on its decent into Leeds. This was a very spectacular sight, as just as the airliner passed the lower red object, it ascended virtically at a very high rate of speed before winking out and disapearing. At which point the larger higher bright white and red object that had remained fairly stationary, although seemed to change in size and shape in cycles, now from what I could see began to move to the west, con! stantly pulsating red and white light, until it too winked out and disappeared into the distance at a very fast rate to the west. At which point I made the journey back home to talk to my family about what I had seen, who also had exact same accounts to what I had just witnessed. Now these objects were fairly stationary in the sky for at least around 10 minutes before making movement and departing sight. In that time not only did the previous airliner above pass through the airspace but another Jet2.com from paris CDG also on approach into Leeds. Both of these must have also seen the objects, as must have Leeds air traffic control. Thank you.',\n",
       "       \"I saw a light blue UFO with a low sound emitted that seemed to abduct a dog, and then vanish. I walked into the hall tonight to hear from the open window a low, small sound. It was as if a plane were overhead, but it was so peculiar - so unlike any plane I'd ever heard - I had to step outside. My dogs were going crazy trying to get out the back screen door, scratching and barking. I let them out and walked a few steps under my gazebo, confused, and then I saw it, partly obscured by the top of the structure. It was bright blue and flashing lights of some sort. I wasn't sure if there were more than one - I saw it for an instant. There may have been an abduction - another dog barking in the background stopped suddenly after a flash of light. Then suddenly as I stepped out to get a better view, it lingered for an instant and suddenly vanished as if by magic. The noise, however, did not stop.\",\n",

       "       'doughnut shaped, brightly lite, hovering object southeastern NC 6:45 am on 3/05/2009 On March 5, 2009 at approx. 6:45 am est. on the way down the side walk going to the vehicle, a bright object captured our attention. The object was moving erratically in the sky and was slightly larger than the planet Venus just after dark or just before dawn.  It was about 25 to 30 degrees in the morning sky about 6 to 10 miles away and we were facing south. The digital camera we used was hand held and not on a bipod as we were not expecting to capture anything morning. The weather was clear, no cloud cover, no rain, perfect and cool. The object, as stated earlier, moved erratically for a short time then stopped and hovered for about 5 minutes. The photo numbered 705 is the picture of the object just hovering.  Once stopped we could tell that it was shaped circular like a doughnut with lights of every color around the outside of the craft with a solid center.  After hovering for 5 minutes or so the object took off moving north relatively fast making no sound what so ever. My son and I saw the object and even though we have been looking for it every morning since we have not seen the object again.  I do realize that alot of people try to hoax the public and are out for their 15 minutes of fame.  This is not the case as we want no media what so ever. Just simply an answer for what we have seen in the sky over our home would suffice.  We understand that may not be possible but just knowing somewhere someone has seen something similar would help. We are not nut cases claiming abduction and honestly we have reservations about the people who do.  My son is a 12 yr old 7th grader and i am a building sub-contractor.',\n",

I awoke as if it was timed very strange my eyes opened i was completly aware of where i was in the house and alone and looking outside. There was a shape with 6 to 7 lights (round) moving in a couterclockwise motion from left to right,  The movement was like like looking at a clock face meaning i could always see the lights moving first in the circle than travelling as one to the right and moving in a circle and than travelling together to the left moving in a circle first before it travelled.d I kept my eyes on it and then it dissolved.  The color of the lights was bright white. It wasn't a craft in that you could make out a 3 dimensioanl form it was just there like a presence but the lights never moved out of their shape  The closest shape i can think of was like the shape of a sacrum (the body) not quite a an upside down triangle but more rounded. .  After it dissolved i did feel a kind of gravitation to and from in my body but not feeling anykind of abduction or that i was in danger. The yard next door has  swimming pool and a large deck around it.

       "       'A group of small red, white and gold blinking lights flying over my house in West Virginia. I have filed a report before regarding lights in the sky behind my house.  Last night I once again saw something strange by my house.  I was watching the sky from my back deck, looking for the lights that I saw on previous nights, when something red caught the corner of my eye.  I turned to my right towards a large tree that sits beside my house.  I saw the strangest thing I have ever seen in my life.  I watched a craft or light of some sort about the size of a kitchen table or slightly larger appear from just over the top of the tree.  It was not very large and I could not make out the shape of it as it was dark.  It looked like a circular shape, perhaps. I saw several lights coming off of it.  These lights blinked and were very bright in intensity.  They were red, gold and white with several blinking at the same time. They appeared to blink in almost a triangular fashion.  I noticed mostly the red color.  The craft drifted at a medium pace across the sky over me from the tree to my right towards another tree to my left.  Then, it disappeared from my view behind the tree.  The duration was about 30 seconds in length.  It made no sound whatsoever. I then became scared and ran into the house.  I got my video camera and came back out about 10 minutes later, but the light never came back.  Later, at night, I laid down to go to bed.  It was about midnight according to the clock.  I closed my eyes for a few minutes and then heard my son cry out, which is common.  I thought that I had just laid down and I was agitated that I had to get up right when I had gotten comfortable.  I sat up and looked at the clock.  Approximately two hours had passed from when I first laid down, only it had felt like only a few minutes to me.  The clock read that it was sometime after two in the morning!  I really do not feel that I fell asleep during that time and feel that I am missing about two hours of time.  I can not say for sure, though.  When I opened my eyes once I heard my son cry, my body hurt all over.  I! thought to myself that it was strange, that I felt as if I had been hit by a truck.  My entire body was very sore.  Today my shoulders hurt, but that may be due to the weather changes.  I am not saying that I was abducted during the night, however I sincerely feel that I am missing almost two hours that I cannot account for.  The other lights I have been unsure of what they are, however what I saw last night I am convinced was not of this world.',\n",
       "       'Bright light seen in Virginia Beach   I was taking my dog outside when I saw a bright, cross shaped UFO hovering over my apartment complex. I watched it for a minute or so, then went inside to get a camera but I left my dog outside. When I came back out,the UFO was still there, so I turned on the camera, but by the time I snapped the picture it was gone. My dog was nowhere to be found. Minnie (the dog) always stays close by, so I am convinced that the craft abducted my dog. The craft appeared to have a relatively low altitude, probably 1000ft.

       "       'In the first sighting i could essentially draw you a picture of the craft and i was chased by a UFO in the 2nd sighting   After being extremely frightened over this 2nd UFO encounter in the past 2 weeks I had to mention these recent events to someone, just so it could be known.  The date today is the 11th of August, 2008.  This was actually my 2nd UFO encounter in about the past week and a half.  I would first like to talk about my first encounter which happened about 1 and a half weeks ago.  It was about 9:45 PM and I had been at my friend’s house across town.  I started to head back home which was about a 15 minute drive.  On the way home I noticed 2 large lights about 60 to 80 feet hovering in the air, lights almost touching each other.  As I began to drive towards the lights I actually began to joke to myself that this might be a UFO.  I continued on highland drive and when I got to the Amort’s farming fields I clearly saw this object floating soundless in the air.  Other cars drove extremely slow past this object, as if to wonder what was sitting up in the air.  The strange thing was of the 3 or 4 cars I saw pass this object, no one stopped or got out of their car, but each car drove past this thing at about 5mph to catch a glimpse.  As I drove past this object I could clearly see the shape and color of this unknown craft.  It was diamond shaped with 4 bright lights on each corner.  The crazy thing was you could see these lights from so far away but when you got up the craft the lights appeared pretty small.  Also when I looked into this light it didn’t hurt my eyes as a regular light would.  As I rolled down the street almost directly under this craft I rolled down my window and heard no noise, at all.  Please tell me what can float 80 feet off the ground and not make noise.  The lights on the bottom of the craft are what created enough light to view the craft.  The bottom of the diamond was some sort of black material.  After passing the craft on the long street of highland I was only about 2 minutes away from my house and I wanted to get my brother and a video camera as proof to this sighting.  Unfo! rtunatel y when I arrived home he was gone and 10 minutes later when I returned the object had vanished.  When I got back home my parents were now there and I decided to tell them about this strange event.  On the way home they had seen this object in the Amort’s farming fields just like I had.  I figured out that they passed by this same object about 5 minutes after I had.  My parent’s first impression of the object was it was not normal and was a UFO.  They believed as they passed the object it began to move forward slowly but they never saw it disappear quickly.  The funny thing about this is that my family and I decided not to report this; I decided to report it after what happened to me, tonight, the night of August 11th.  I was over at one of my brother’s friend’s houses and it was about 11:15 PM.  I was tired and decided to head back to my house.  I was almost to my street when I noticed a weird light hovering, in place, a good distance behind the Warlow’s farming fields.  I decided that because of my recent sighting nearly 2 weeks ago, that I would park in their driveway and watch this red light.  I noticed that the object began to hover straight up into the air at a pretty fast pace.  The object reached a height of probably about 200 to 300 feet and began to move fast towards my vehicle.  At this point I was pretty much scared shit less and pulled back as fast I could and made a fast dash towards my house.  The object hovered parallel with my vehicle but essentially right above me.  I remember as I made the sharp turn onto my street I glanced out my window and up into the sky and there it was right above me, following me but still at an altitude of about 200 to 300 feet.  I could clearly see the lights on the UFO and the brightness of the moon made everything pretty visible.  It was high enough up that I couldn’t quite make out the shape but it moved quickly.  At this point I was freaked out of my mind and my adrenaline was running.  The object proceeded to follow me up my street until I made it to a lar! ge pass of overhanging trees.  I live out in the forest and there are a lot of trees that hang over my street, it creates some good cover from the skies.  As I reached this pass of overhanging trees before my house I was continuously looking in the air to see if the UFO was still present.  When I got to my house I was so scarred I didn’t even get out of my car.  I locked the doors and called my mom to open the front door of my house, so I could run in with no delays.  This event scared me to the point of reporting both these UFO incidents event though I had been contemplating revealing the first incident.  The thing about this 2nd one is that I was out by myself witnessing all of this.  My lights were shined out towards the UFO which probably got its attention because after about a minute or 2 it headed straight towards me.  I really thought this unknown craft was trying to do something the way it responded to me showing up and witnessing it out in the Warlow field.  The craft had 3 lights, 1 red and 2 white (bright).  This may sound like a plane or something but this was not, I know for a fact.  It made no sound, flew 200 to 300 feet above the ground almost directly above my car, the craft essentially engaged me and I ran.  In my mind I really believed it was trying to abduct me and luckily I was about 1 minute from my house and I went about 50 to 60 mph on a 25 mph street to escape this thing that was tailing me.  I strongly have believed in aliens before these events but I feel unsafe out here.  This is the 2nd UFO I have seen and unfortunately I have to pictures or videos to prove it, just the fact that my parents saw the first sighting and they strongly believe there was no possibility it was from this planet.  I’m now carrying a video camera in my car and will update this site if I capture or see anything else.  I hope my word and others will soon unveil the alien presence on earth.  P.S:  I just wrote this right after my 2nd incident with a UFO as seen above in my script',\n",

He was astonished that a small \"child\" could be so far up a tree that was on fire . the craft opened the bottom but hovered by means of bouncing electrial sparks. the memorys end except he remembers reading the paper the next day to see about the fire ,but that was all said ,nothing about maxwell AFB. my brother is a genuis by the way ,athletic as well and my mom just happened to work at the base when pregnant in the hospital.There are other coincidences! as well.

       "       'Gray cigar-shaped object hovering   When I was 10 or 11 years old, my mother was working outside in the yard and called to my brother and I to come outside quickly. We ran outside and my mother pointed to a field approximately 100-150 yards from our house. About 100 yards above the field, there was hovering a very large, cigar-shaped object. It made a deep humming sound. No engine sound.  The object appeared to be spinning around as it hovered. It was dark gray in color. We were fascinated and continued to watch it just hover in the same spot until it suddenly shot up through the sky and disappeared. My mother sent my brother and I to the neighbors houses to see if anyone else had seen it. All the neighbors whose doors I knocked on refused to open their door which was very unusual at that time. Some of them were very frightened and said through the door that they had not seen anything. We never verified that anyone had witnessed it.  Both my mother and I recall this event clearly however my mo! ther to this day insists she was abducted and then set back down.  I only recall standing in front of it and staring at it for some period of time.  Best guess:  couple of minutes but actual time unknown.  Years later I joined the military and served in Army Aviation.  I spent years on military airfields and never saw or heard anything similar.',\n",
       "       \"I! I found out! We went camping to the top of the East fork in Azusa Canyon.  Me and my friend were unloading the firewood then asked me what is that?  I looked up to what he pointed to and I saw stars and what looked like a star but moving at a steady pace. I told him it was probably a satellite and just as soon as the words left my mouth it changed directions and hyper spaced away.  It was at first traveling from East to West and then shot off North.   At the time I was susceptible about other life forms. That day changed my mind.  With all these sitings, even the one in Riverside, CA.  I witnessed three orbs that early evening and so did 100's of people, but Uncle Sam told us it was weather balloons!   The next day they appeared again this time instead of lights they were clear orbs but did not move like the afternoon before.  Our government is being secretive.  Why did they stop investigating UFO's  and abduction?\",\n",
       "       'Large hovering triangle UFO seen at close distance, object followed us home, This was about 15 years ago but a sighting none the less.  I was 17 my brother was 18 and had just graduated from high school.  We had recently moved from the bigger city of Normal, IL to a small country town called Mackinaw about 20 miles away.  We still had friends in Normal so we would often go hang out in there on weekends.  One Friday night that spring after playing cards and handing out with friends (no drugs or alcohol were consumed) my brother and I took off for home about midnight or so.  Being that we lived out of town, we had to go through a stretch of what I would call country roads to get home.  My brother was driving and as we were just on the outskirts of Normal, I started looking at the sky.  It was a very clear night and a lot of stars were visible.  As I looked up I noticed a light that looked like an airplane light blinking however it was moving around in a very odd manner.  It looked like it was dancing around the sky.  It looked like it ! was jumping from spot to spot instead of flying in a strait line like an airplane.  As I watched this light, all of a sudden I saw a red ball of light shoot out from it strait into the sky.  I started freaking out and told my brother to stop the car so he could see this light.  He did and we sat and watched this light continue to dance around in the sky.  We got kind of freaked out and started driving again towards home.  At this point we were still about 20 miles from home.  As we drove on about another two miles, we came to a stop sign.  There was a large grain elevator just accross from the stop sign to our right.  As we passed the grain elevator, we looked up and saw a large Triangle UFO hovering about 100 feet over our head.  It looked to be rotating on some kind of axis and it had lighs that looked to be circling around it.  It made no noise whatsoever.  We screamed and I yelled at my brother to get the hell moving.  The rest of the way home, this UFO hovered over our! car at about a distance of 100 feet.  All I could think of is! that we were going to be abducted by aleins at any minute.  It was such a nerve racking ride home as my brother did what he could to drive while I just watched this UFO following us.  As we made our final approach to the subdivising we had just moved to, the UFO just kept going until it was out of our view.  This encounter lasted almost 25 minutes and I still wonder what it was that I saw that night.  I can only think of theree explanations: 1. Our government is hundereds of years more advanced than they let us know about. 2. Another country is hundreds of years more advanced than we are. or 3. We are being visited by alien beings.  Those are absoluetley the only explanations possible for what I saw that night.  This was not a helicopter or a plane.  I wish I could meet more people that have had an experience like this and to share more details of our experience that night.

       "       'Bus shaped object with 4 bright lights 20 feet off ground seen in rural eastern North Carolina. I was driving north on Bynum Avenue in Maysville, NC to one my friend\\'s house.There were two other guys with me. Bynum is a small rural residential road, only about 1 mile long.  We noticed what at first looked like a semi truck facing us on the road near the intersection of Bynum and First Street.  My friend\\'s house sits about 500 feet from the intersection, left of North Bynum.  Just before we arrived, my friend in the front leaned up and asked, \"What is that!?\" We all looked and saw at least 4 bright circular lights, which faced South. The object looked like it had a shape like a greyhound bus. The lights had a yellowish tint and were about 20 feet off the ground. I pulled into the yard, our line of sight with the object was obstructed for just moments by a large  line of bushes which sit along the bank of the ditch.  We all walked to the street to see it up close, but the object was gone.  Neither of us heard any sounds. If were the lights were at was in! deed the front, then it would have had to turn around.  The object never passed behind us. In the yard you can see Bynum, first, second, and mattocks streets.  No vehicle traveled down either street. We still talk about that today.  I have always been hesitant to report it, but after watching a few documentaries about the topic, I was compelled.  I often wonder if we were abducted and placed back in the car or yard..',\n",

       "       \"Oval white light with no navigational lights travelling to the northeast. While working outside, I looked up at the stars to the southwest and noticed an oval white light that I thought to be a landing light of an aircraft coming towards me.  The light was moving faster than what I thought it should be and also observed that there were no navigational lights that an aircraft would be flashing (green for right and red for left). The light continued to the northeast with no sound until I saw an obvious aircraft with navigational lights travelling to the northwest. he light stopped as if it was at a traffic light and as soon as the obvious aircraft passed, the light continued on it's northeastern path. I thought that was pretty strange and approx. a half hour or 45 minutes later while walking back to the office, something was biting the left side of my neck. Thinking it was a bug of sometype, I tried squishing it on my neck but the intense biting sensation continued.  Thinking it was a bug bite of sometype, I ignored the painful bite for a couple of days until I saw a nurse who worked at the same place I do.  I asked her to look at this painful bug bite for me on my neck and upon looking at it, she informed me that it was a burn and not a bite.  She said the burn was a triangular shape. A day or two later, I had my son take a picture of the triangular burn and upon relating what happened and expecting him to laugh at me, he immediately went to the computer and pulled up a very similar triangular mark on a male allegedly made by aliens when he was abducted. While I wasn't abducted, the uncanny similiarity of the two triangular marks, both appearing like arrowheads, leads me to be suspicious of what I really saw that night. It was a clear night, no clouds, stars could easily be seen, and there were no fires or any other instruments/equipment near me that could have burned me in such a manner.  I still have the scar on my neck as well as the pictures of the burn.\",\n",
       "       'UFO in the shape of a triangle My experience with a UFO I put the date as 1984, since this has been many years ago, I\\'m not sure if it was 84 or 85.  I didn\\'t know anything about ufo reporting until watching a ufo show on tv.  The Community was Glen Rose outside of Malvern.  I\\'m not sure what time it was or day, it was night and I had taken my poodle, \"Cuddle\\'s,\" outside to do his thing. Something drew my attention to what looked like a star, but watching it for I don\\'t know how long, I realized the \"star\" was too close to the ground.   I continued watching, again I don\\'t know how long I watched this; I went into the house and got my two daughters and my eldest daughter\\'s boy friend to come outside and look at this thing.   We stood on the porch again watching, what looked like a star, don\\'t know how long we stood there, finallly I remember saying it was moving, then I thought it was a helicopter that was moving toward us.  Everything seemed slow.  The thing, was coming near, there was no sound, we watched as the object went almost directly over us, no sound, there was the white light at the front, with blue or green lights and it seems a red light somewhere, it has been so long ago to remember the details.  It was triangular shape. Ater this:  I read a book about UFO\\'s and it had the triangular ufo\\'s mentioned like we saw on this summer night.   I wrote the author and to my surprise he wrote back, I had told the author I had these small encaved objects on my skin, like a doodle bug home, this was mentioned in his book.  The author told me he couldn\\'t say if I had been abducted at some time but gave me some names of hypmotist in local states that I could see, he also said that this could be very tramautic to me, I decided not see anyone. I do still have the letter from the author but haven\\'t searched for them yet, unless you would  like to see the documents. The UFO came from the west. The only witness not around is my daughter I lost in a car accident at the age of fifteen. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))',\n",
       "       \"Early morning abduction   Report of UFO Contact in the year 1970 summer. I was eleven years of age and lived on a farm with my parents, grand parents, three younger brothers and one sister.  We lived approximately 21 miles west of the town of Geneseo, IL.  Our closest neighbor lived just across the road and down about ¼ mile and our house was almost completely surrounded by woods. One night in the summer, I became aware that I was not in bed in the basement of the house where I and my siblings slept but rather I was sitting on a bench in a “room” with one adult male who was about in his mid 20's.  The room was constructed of metal as were the benches, there was one door  in the compartment and on either side of the door were “windows” from which I could see a passageway going to the left and right and had a slightly slanted inward wall turning into the ceiling of the passageway.  The other person in the compartment with me sat on the bench to the left side of the door and completely ignored me even when I shook him and tried to get him to look at me, he just sat on the bench with his elbows on his knees gazing downward between his legs at the floor.  I tried to open the door but it was locked and I got up on the bench to the right side of the door and leaned against the glass which slanted outward and tried to see something beside the metal walls but ! all I saw was an empty passageway.   The room was lighted but I did not see any source of light such as a light bulb. After I looked around the basically empty compartment I again tried to get the adult male in the compartment with me to pay attention to me and help me understand what was happening to us but still he just sat there.  I looked up at the window and saw a “creature” about 4.5 feet tall, I think covered almost totally with a reddish long hair but his face looked human like and it did not pay any attention to us in the compartment, just slowly walking by the window.  I was very scared and when I'm afraid of something of someone I tended to attack.  I jumped on to the bench and them beat on the “glass” and screamed and tried to break the glass but at the same time was scared to death I would break it.  The being just kept walking by and it was shortly there after that I stopped remembering anything. I woke up the next morning about 4:30 when it was time to go do the morning chores.  I never did tell my parents or anyone else because I was sure that they would not believe me.  Additionally, I did not know the other person in that compartment with me.  I have never had another incident like this that I can recall.  As far as the creature that I saw there, I have never seen anything like it again until the time I watched the movie Star Wars and that “Woki” had some resemblance to the being.\",\n",

Carolina Beach N.C. cigar I shined my bright headlights on it!Entry Date 7/20/00   As best as i can recall as time frames escape me, in the summer of 1987 as a resident of Carolina Beach,N.C.  my mother began yelling from our back porch that she was seeing a u.f.o..  After ignoring her cries for three times,I was compelled to go check the situation out because of her \"close encounter\" scream! Upon entrance of the back porch facing the ocean ,I then observed a tubular shaped flying vehicle beaming the most spectacular blinding light into the ocean waters not more than 1000 yards away from shore!I turned to Mom and We both began to more or less \"freak-out\" about what We were seeing! I then instructed her to examine every detail about this \"thing\" so that We could better remember it\\'s design. Imagine,if you will,say a 747 jet without any wings or tail,only gigantical and unpainted,the bare metal design showing no rivets whatsoever.Windows adorned the side from front to back and forms of occupants were hazily seen behind some in the mid-section.It made no noise! I! t hovered over the ocean as if looking for something in the shallow surf[speculation].I then left Mom and ran to the car and sped away at at least 80m.p.h. in a 20m.p.h. zone to the Phelps\\' pier at the end of Carolina Ave. North and slung the car around to face the still oncoming slow sailing airship. This angered local residents who came to confront my recklessness , but once I pointed to that \"thing\" all was astonished at \"it\".As it neared I clicked my bright headlights on it. It then slowly swung around and faced me dead straight! It now looked like a circle and had it\\'s light off. It began to hover over me. At this point I closed my eyes and began to fervently PRAY!! When I looked back up ,it slowly moved back to surf just beyond the pier and \"blasted\" is too slow the term for it\\'s departure! Instantly in the distance Wrightsville Beach N.C. lit up from the u.f.o.\\'s lightbeam. After a few min. the same thing began at Topsail Beach\\'N.C. . This happened up the North Carol! ina eastern coastline untill it faded from my sight. When I ! ! returned home my mom said local news would carry the story at 11:00 which was just coming up. In a brief report , they mentioned that the u.f.o. sightings being called in was nothing more than a \"Coast Guard Drug Survailence Vehicle\"! O.K. Carolina Beach \\'You remember this!! Who could ever forget?! Back me up on this!  UPDATE AND CORRECTIONS TO ORIGINAL POST ABOVE  I wanted to be more precise on this as it was something that was vague in it\\'s post back then. I just wanted to clarify it.It bothers me that so far only the first witness(my mom)has responded and posted about this event. As best as I can recollect,(as the exact time frame escapes me),it was in the summer start in 1987 of mid April. I was a local resident of Carolina Beach, NC. Lying on my back in bed, playing an electric guitar unplugged, I began to hear my mother yelling from our back porch that she was seeing a UFO. After ignoring her three times,I was finally compelled to rise up and go check the situation out because she had just frantically ran up to my locked door and screamed out... \"It\\'s a close encounter of the 3rd kind!\" So with that statement it really got my attention and upon my entrance out the back door onto the porch facing the ocean ,I then observed a very large and long tubular shaped flying vehicle that was beaming the most spectacular blinding light into the ocean waters not more than 1,000 yards away from shore! I turned to Mom and we both began to more or less \"freak-out\" about what we were seeing! I was astonished at it\\'s huge dimensions and how far it spanned down the! coastline to it\\'s right from it\\'s front front. It had large rectangular windows that started from behind the nose section all the way to the rear. I was stunned at the close up encounter of this ship because of it\\'s magnitude and awe commanding presence. I turned and looked at my mom and saw an expression I had never seen on her face and told her ...\"You should see the look on your face\" and she replied the same thing back to me! I then instructed her to please examine and to pay close attention to every detail about this \"thing\" so that we could better remember it\\'s design having no camera to capture the image. I told her to remember the details and we were to write them down on paper later that night while all was fresh on our minds. We then began pointing out to each other how this airship has no signs of being assembled and riveted. It was so flawless. No signs on it at all of any wear or rust or scratches etc. We were close enough looking right from the back porch tha! t if I had a rock I could have struck it with ease as there wa! s no way I could have missed the monster sized UFO. Imagine a 747 jet shape without any wings or tail or front windows but only gigantic and unpainted. It rose very high and was very round and blimpish. Bare metal in design and showing no rivets whatsoever. Gigantic rectangular windows adorning the side from front to back (which by the way was easily several football fields long or yet longer in length) and there was this greenish/yellowish blurry light in the center section with forms of occupants that were hazily seen because it seemed to make you unable to focus upon them. It made no noise! It hovered over the ocean as if looking for something in the shallow surf with a blinding beam of light that shot out from it\\'s bottom side. This wide and bright light did not shine outwards but stayed in a curtain like drop from the bottom that lit up the ocean water like the color of a swimming pool looks in lights at night while all surroundings were dark grayish night. It was slowly passin! g by but still right in front of us when I decided to get the car and go down the road towards the end of the island to see it approaching from that view. I left mom by herself on the back porch and grabbed her car keys off a hook on the wall by the front doorway and took her Plymouth Volare without her permission (my car had a weak battery before this)and sped away at at least 80 MPH in the 20 MPH zone to get to the Phelps\\' pier at the end of Carolina Avenue North. When I got there I slung the  steering wheel a hard right and spun the car around in order to face the still oncoming slow sailing airship that soon would hopefully arrive. This angered some local residents but especially disturbed some tourists who confronted my recklessness from the balconies of some adjacent condos. They began \"telling me off\" and how they had indeed called the police. The police department was less than a mile away and it would just take minutes to get there. I told them...\"Good... we\\'re gon! na need them!\" That comment seemed to scare them as if I had j! ust thre atened them. I recall they had a Queens New York styled or New Jersey type accent/dialect. One particular man in that group asked me why was I acting so strange and what was I trying to accomplish by my odd reckless behavior. I had gotten the car stuck in the sand and had it in a weird position and I now was just standing outside the driver\\'s side door with my leg inside ready to click the high beams on. I replied...\"You\\'ll see\"! He thought I was crazy and my answers were a threat. But I was so focused on trying to locate that UFO thing that nothing bothered me. It was a grayish dark night. The UFO had turned off it\\'s lights and I could not see it. I walked out to the surf and looked right down the shoreline and it was nowhere to be seen. I was standing there thinking I was about to be arrested or took away to be evaluated when it dawned on me I was looking right at it! From the direct front it was a large circle! It blended in with the sky but was coming onward straight ahe! ad like I hoped it was. I ran to the car and positioned my foot above the high beam switch on the floorboard. That man continued asking me why I doing the things I was and that cops would be here any minute and I knew if I said anything about a UFO that it would only go from bad to worse so I just pointed at the area where it soon would appear and said ...\"Just keep lookin\\' right there fellow!\" As it neared I clicked the bright headlights on it. Two small headlight dots appeared upon the giant blimp like structure. They all saw it and began to go insanely frightened and saying all kinds of stuff and it caused me to smirk when they began asking me what it was etc.(As if I knew!)It then slowly swung around and faced me dead straight! It now looked like that circle. It began to hover right over me.I knew I had made this event happen by not minding my own business and it was now hovering at me. At this point I closed my eyes and began to fervently pray!I was so scared that I sm! ashed my face into the sand and was screaming out to God to sa! ve me. I think I repented for things I never did but feared I was perhaps about to die by maybe that light that can come from it\\'s underside. That man that talked to/at me earlier was saying...\"You can come up from there...it\\'s leaving! It\\'s backing up man!\" But I was too frightened to believe him but he kept insisting it was cool to look up. So when I looked up it was slowly moving backwards just beyond the pier and then it turned so precise and they all saw its huge cigar shape just long enough to get a good mental picture and in just a split second it \"blasted\" (too slow of a term)away! More screams and explicatives came from the condo balconies and I pointed to the horizon to the left where the night lights of Wrightsville Beach NC were twinkling from and then instantly there in the distance, Wrightsville Beach NC lit up from that UFO\\'s light beam. After a few minutes the same thing began to repeat itself at Topsail Beach etc. This happened up the North Carolina eastern coastlin! e until it faded like \"heat lightning\" from our sight. Those people who were angered at me...well they helped me get out of the sand and I went back home never once encountering an officer of the law kind! When I returned home my mom gave me an earful for leaving her alone and taking her car but then said that the local news was going to carry the story at 11:00 PM which was just coming up. In a brief report by a girl who\\'s first name was Michelle, they mentioned that the UFO sightings being called in was nothing more than a \"Coast Guard Drug Surveillance Vehicle\" ! (I later asked the local news station for a copy of that broadcast and they told me that they don\\'t archive news broadcasts). My mom and I both that very night had drawn our pictures of the craft and wrote out our affidavits about our encounter and put them in a separate file among the important paperworks stored in a special closet. Later that year we had to move and that particular paperwork was all we found missing! Many years went by and I\\'ve told this event to hundreds of listeners. I once told a retired Air Force officer and he cussed me out and told me that I had better keep my @#$%% mouth shut if I knew what was good for me. He continued cussing me out until I was red faced and hot under the collar and he drove off down the wrong side of the highway pulled over at a nearby phone booth and made a phone call. My wife was disturbed and asked me to quit telling others. Later that night when we got home, we found someone had entered our home with no sign of breaking in. We never found anything out of place except that someone had entered the house and installed a new cartridge of ink in our printer and used over half of it. It\\'s like they wanted us to know it. The strangest part of my encounter is that it was not late and had not been dark very long when I laid back to play my guitar. But when I returned home it was almost eleven o\\' clock. I was not abducted. I did not recall anything longer than perhaps thirty minutes time taking place. That missing time thing has bothered me. And those people on the balconies may have took photos. They had a lot of time to do that. And the police never showed up. And the TV station constantly shows archived footages of old news. If I\\'m sounding somewhat paranoid then it\\'s only because I have what I consider to be good valid reasons. And to make it even weirder is that in the very same location where the UFO was first encountered, me and my brother-in-law both watched the figure of a person come out of the surf there one night in what seemed like gray flannel attire compete with a hood that covered the head and although it should have been dripping wet it\\'s attire was completely dry and flapping in the wind and then it just vaporized in front of us! For readers this is the 800 block of Carolina Avenue North. OK Carolina Beach people in April of \\'87... you remember this!! Who could ever forget?! Back me up on this!

       "       'Connected On Feb 14th 2007 @ 1:11AM I was awakened by a gut feeling of a need to go out side onto the balcony; 5th floor of an apartment building.  I had felt a strong presence as if I were being watched.  The feeling was as if I knew the heavenly being that was observing me from above.  I glanced up in to the winter starry night as I watched the stars, just above and over to the left of me was a Black (blacker than any night) Craft. This craft hovered in complete silence, it stood still and on every corner of this craft was what seemed to be a star (light) a total of 3 lights the craft was triangle in shape and was very low and I actually spoke out towards it’s direction and said (Oh so their you are) I had a over coming feeling as if I know him. I was visited that night before my departure back to New York. I was troubled and was deep in thoughts of prayers before I went into a deep sleep. I felt a comforting presence along my bedside and I opened my eyes and I seen him. He was about 3 -4feet tall, kneeling over me and had his hands in prayer. He was praying for me. If I could describe Him, He was radiant, a white glow, a heavenly presence a true being of a higher intelligence. He reminded me of a baby in the 5th month trimester of the womb. Beautiful just simply Beautiful and a spiritual Plato ore surrounded me with senses of energy that is a often reminder that makes me feel calm and brings tears of a unspeakable experience that makes my chest rise heavy with over whelming Joy and Love and True happiness. He knows of me always has and he is a guardian sent by God we are not alone and Jesus was right we all were sent by the father.  We aren’t the only creatures in the Galaxy; there are many Galaxies and many more creatures created by the almighty creator in the master piece in life. Who is man to say that no 1 can create another you?   By who’s rule?  By who understands?  By who’s knowledge?  By who’s a law? Did you know that our cousins are coming back?  Do you know God?  I do.  And this isn’t my first experience I had a premonition as a child and he visited me (abduction) of the past into the future of what is to come. Man must change his ways for the good of us all ((NUFORC Note:  Location not indicated by the source of the report.  We have guessed at the location.

       "       'female human abducted by aliens. UFO /  Aliens..... abducted me on Feb 1 2010 around 8am when I was home alone and I regained consciousness around 11am. I had some kind of ((deleted))  and within my mind I was regressed backwards in time, in speech, in my own life............ I kept my eyes closed so I didn\\'t look at them................ I told myself you will get through this....Jesus/ God is with me......... When I woke up out of a trance state....I was on my bed and was freezing, shivering and wet the bed/towel I had around me from the shower. It hit me with a force/blow from behind.  I fell face first on to my bed...I had just finished a shower and had a lavender towel wrapped around me....the dogs were with me........ I found myself flat on the bed face down.  I couldn\\'t move my body.  Paralyzed.  Something felt like it entered my body...like a lizard or a snake moves....within me.  I was not me...it was inside me and it controlled my thoughts...it wanted me in a fearful state. On the morning of Feb 1 2010 there was a UFO sighting in Ansonia, CT, within the hour of me being attacked.  If you look at the map from a birds eye view-Ansonia looks alot like the Thames river. I am not afraid.  I am not going to let this event reck my life.  I am not alone in this situation.  Why won\\'t the United States Government, CIA, FBI-come clean on this?   What is the long term agenda?  The hardest part in all of this is family members think you need a straight jacket.  There\\'s no way to prove what I went through.  I have talked with the \"shrinks\" on the high demand of my family.  Of course they can only offer medication. I think I should write a book about it because that might be the only path I can take to know I didn\\'t just dream all of this.  I know there are other women that have undergone what I went through and there are men too.  When abduction occurs you are paralyzed. You want to scream, hit,s wing, or try to communicate with them-somehow but, all the parts of your body won\\'t work.  I could close my eyes-that\\'s it. I had a sighting a few years ago on 7/23/2005 and reported a triangle shape w/ 6 witnesses.  We had one hour lost time.  So, I feel \\'THEY\\' have come back to see me again.  For what I don\\'t know.  A year has gone by since this Feb. event and it took me over a year to report it.  I\\'ve had all the test done to me MRI,SCAT SCAN, Blood work....I even had a doctor tell me to seek an exorcist.   Sorry, I won\\'t be sucked into the game. There is an agenda people.....I don\\'t know what it is but, it wanted me to be afraid.... it seems to live on fear.  I will be happy to talk to the people who work for this web sight.',\n",

I have to conclude that these were bad dreams, and people that claim abduction at nite from their beds are also having bad dreams. The media has created this image of the grays, and it is unnerving, unsettling. What are the triangles? Why doesn't someone build an array of video cameras and make a constant observation of the night sky for an extended period of time?

       "       \"Looks like a Star Wars ship,without the top, smooth, silent, no lights, large and low to the ground.. Old UFO report. This sighting occurred in the early 1970's on River Road in Wilmington, NC around 2 am in the morning.  I am reporting it now because I am older and have heard of similar objects being seen on UFO tv reports.  So what the heck, I'll tell what I saw and maybe it will do some good. I was in my convertible traveling north along River Road about 2 am.  It was a clear night and the stars where out, no fog or clouds.  Then a very large craft came over the trees, I was very scared and thought 'what if I'm abducted'.  I pulled my car over so as not to draw attention to myself.  It was massive, about the width and length of a football field.  The shape reminded me of one of those Star Wars big star ships like the one at the beginning of the 1st episode but it didn't have a large top area, it was smooth and triangular, at the end it had 3 very large round engines just like the Star Wars ship.   The color was identical to the sky, when it went over me it blacked out the stars but looked like a hole in the sky because of the color match.   It was moving slowly, I'd say not much more than 35 mph and just above the trees, about 120 feet (tree hight 80' plus another 40').  It was dead silent, no noise at all and no lights, no windows that I could see,  As it pa! ssed, heading south, that's when I saw its features.   I watched until out of sight then got out of there.  I've kept it to myself until recently and then joked I saw a UFO then woke up.  But, what the heck, if will do some good or maybe someone else will recognize the description. I wonder what they have been doing all these years.  Obviously not attacking.  As I see it, if you have the means to travel like they must, you have access to all the resources you would ever want so mental growth would be more of a priority than desires to acquire things.  Hope this helps. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))\",\n",
       "       'Two people see UFO hovering at a distance of 10 feet. I heard Peter Davenport on the 07-29-10 episode of Coast to Coast AM and decided to submit my story. Headline: UFO at a stone\\'s throw  This story takes place in 1992 in Illinois. My friend and I were parked facing north at night in the summer on a small concrete bridge over a small creek in rural Illinois.  We were not quite ready to go home and wanted to continue our conversation about \"girlfriends.\"  The weather was cloudy and misty.  We could see sheet lighting in the distance.  My car windows had droplets of water on them.  I sat in the driver\\'s seat, my friend sat in the passenger\\'s seat of my Ford Escort. The creek bridge had cement guardrails that were almost perfectly level with where the car windows started.  I suspect this was a purposeful choice by the architect. The road continued on north to a T-section about 1/4 down the road.  Beyond that intersection was a large hill that spanned for miles in each direction.  Approach to the creek bridge was as if going down a slight hill, and the incline continued on for awhile and then began sloping up again toward the T-section.  We were of a slightly higher altitude than the cornfields directly to the left and right front of us that bordered the creek.  The border of the creek was a slight hill that blocked view of the field beyond to our right (2 o\\'clock).  Over our right shoulders at about 4 o\\'clock (direction), was four-story tall mound/hill left over from an old gravel pit that had trees and brush all over it.  This mound followed the other creek border for about a half a mile to the east. So from our perspective, we could not see the field to our right front, nor see beyond over the hill over our right shoulders.  The creek was essentially bordered on both sides with land that stretched out as far as the eye could see.  It was here that we watched the lighting in the distance.   I could see the lightening from tens of miles away over the top of the distant hills, but there was additional light coming from closer up.  At first I just dismissed it as ball lighting, but I could see the light illuminating the mist just above the hill.  I could not see into the field where the light seemed to be coming from, just the effects of the light on the trees on the border of the creek.  I stopped my friend from talking and said, \"Friend, why is that lightening going on and off with a beat.  Nature is not that exact.\"  I began snapping my fingers to the rate of the light from the field going on and off.  On, snap, off, snap.  It was a perfect beat (I am a musician).  I tol! d my friend to roll down his window and just as the window rolled down, a craft popped out from behind the hill.  It was level with us, and we were approximately at most 10 ft from the craft.  I could have easily jumped on top of the craft from the side of the bridge without straining myself. I was speechless.  At the time I was morally opposed to the idea of alien spacecraft.  My family were strict Christians who specifically were taught at our denomination that humans on Earth were the only organic life in the universe.  I was 100% against the ideas of aliens existing.  Yet, here before me and my friend was this totally silent craft, about the size of a large SUV, hovering, silently. I broke the silence by startling loudly, \"THAT IS NOT A UFO!\"  At the time that I said that, the craft was just a little past us.  The craft was almost directly to our right, but a little farther past us at that point.  It abruptly changed course (as if it heard me) and either turned off its lights, put on a cloaking device or did something else because it seemed to just go right into the opposite hill, but more likely it just went \"dark.\"  I revved up my engine and drove away very fast.  My perspective on everything had just come crashing down in one fell swoop of time no more than 3 minutes long. I got to my house, where my friend\\'s car was, and he asked me to follow him back home (because he was too freaked out to go over that bridge alone).  So I followed him home.  By the time I got back to the bridge, my fear had gone down, and I was filled with wonder.  The storm had passed, so I parked on the bridge again alone, turned on a Cure CD and sat Indian style on the roof of my car, searching the landscape and the sky for anything out of the ordinary. Nothing.  Silence. Oddly, it was from that moment on that I started to experience the phenomenon known as \"synchronicity.\"  As I drove back to my house that night, I though, \"what if when I get home my family has been abducted!\"  I got home and went to my parent\\'s bedroom and listened for breathing.  Nothing, so I turned on the light and the bed was empty and made, at like 2 a.m.!  I ran to my sister\\'s rooms and they were all empty too.  I was freaked out so I just collapsed in bed, thinking in the morning this will all be resolved. I awoke to a call from my mother that the family left town unexpectedly that evening to visit relatives. Description of the craft:  Closure took over in my perception of the craft, so my brain processed the craft as looking like the time machine in Back to the Future (big fan at the time).  It was the only way my brain could process a floating silent vehicle, that and it also did look a lot like that craft.  It had a metallic brushed reflective surface, with an area like a car where the \"people\" were transported, and then a front and back section much like our engine and trunk section.  It as the classic saucer shape, but without the dramatic flaring sides.   It had lights in various places on the exterior but it all happened so fast and I was so stunned that I couldn\\'t tell you the exact placement, but my friend who had no such \"stunned\" effect because he was already a believer, said he saw lights in the back, front, top and bottom of the craft. For now, any contact, I would prefer it to be done via email. ((NUFORC Note:  Date of incident in 1992 is approximate.  PD))',\n",
       "       'Encounter described in details   What I’m about to describe next isn’t open to discussion.  I’ll simply put what I came to know through an experience which can’t be described by words has changed everything. I don’t expect you to believe and, honestly, I don’t even care what you think.  I will never disclose any of my personal information simply because my end of the rope is weaker than the end where a government stands and I still need to pay my bills.  Denial it’s an unbreakable law kept by all means where one’s life value means little or nothing against governments and corporations. Also, I would like to ask your discretion for what I am about to describe will affect the way you see life itself, including religion.  If you truly believe in God, stop reading this.  I wish I had this option myself because once you lose hope, there’s nothing left.  Trust me.   Sometimes, ignorance it’s the best patch to find happiness. I’ll start saying that I’m not American.  This experience has nothing to do with stories about Area 51 or Roosevelt crashes.  I’ve been in 29 countries around the world and speak 5 languages and I work with computers (I will not disclosure my profession). The year is 1999.  Just another Friday night under a beautiful sky, around 2am.  Location: North Japan. Life in Japan is really stressful.  It’s normal to work more than 12 hours a day (at least in my branch).  It’s very different from western countries where people socialize with their neighbors and have a social life.  In Japan, you socialize at work and with family and one’s circle of friends are those people from school times.  Kind of weird but that’s how most people live their lives in that island. So, the most common question: - Were you there alone?   Yes, unfortunately. What were you doing there?   Relaxing. At 2 am?  Many people (like myself) go shopping at the supermarket 2~3am.  It’s normal in north Japan. Does the government know about the incident?   Hell yeah, I saw 2 F-16s trying to catch up before we left, probably from the American military base in Misawa, 15 to 20 miles from where I was. What you mean \"we?\"  Keep reading. I was at the beach on a city Momoishi.  It’s an industrial park that has a long walk patch where you stand 5 to 6 meters above sea level.  This patch was actually built to break waves brought by tsunamis and high waves formed by a typhoon that hits Japan very often. Walking along the patch, the only source of light is the stars and the moon.  If you ever went to a place where there are no cities around, you’ll know what I mean.  The sky shines in a way that it’s impossible to see on the cities.  That goes without talking about the fresh air from the ocean blowing smooth on the hot summer.  Just perfect.  I did that a lot before that faithful day. I walked about 3 miles along the coast before I spotted a bright light coming from the hoods.  I thought it was just young people parted in one of the many parking spots along the cost with their Xenon’s headlights.  In Japan it’s pretty common and affordable to have a custom car, just like you probably saw on movies.  I didn’t really pay too much attention.  Actually, it has kind like blurring my vision because when you walk in the dark and suddenly you see light, your eyes take some time to adapt and you go almost blind when trying to see dark spots again.  So I kept on moving carefully, watching out where I was walking.  I wanted to walk faster so I could kept appreciating the beautiful, quiet and peaceful night but I heard a \"boom\" coming from the light. It was so dammed laud that I thought it was an explosion of some kind.  It scared me to death just like when somebody plays a trick on you.  I looked back and saw that, once bright white light had moved vertically and now has changing colors.  I thought to myself that maybe it was because I was half mile away so it was just a optical trip but I discarded this option because I was the one already at 5 to 6 meters above the sea level walking the patch and I that car supposed to be at least at the same level as I was, not above.  Despise me been blinded again because of the light, I started to run back on the light’s direction.  Maybe someone needed help.  I took my mobile to call the cops.  It was working but it was completely useless. Everything had vanished, including the OS. No line, nothing worked besides the backlight.  That’s when I stop running a got scared.  I got really scared.  I know that takes a great deal to an electronic device to be how to call it, \"erased?\"   And of course, all those stories that you heard about thieves, monsters, and ghosts start flooding your mind and you just get in high alert like your life is in danger or something.  I can’t even describe the feeling.  The air becomes heavy, hard to breath and you just want to get out of there.  I started to run again, blinded by the light.  Of course, the worst happened. I feel from the patch.  Blinded and now hurt, that was the worst that could happen. At first, I didn’t realize how bad I got hurt.  I was trying to find a way to climb back and run to my car and go home. Where I was, there is a small forest between the beach and the patch.  The trees are spaced and almost no ground vegetation.  Depends how is your mood, it can look beautiful or r! eally scary. I stood up back on my feet but when I looked forward, no more that 10 meters away, that small guy with his huge head has staring at me.  My legs gave up on me at the very same moment. I was shaking so much that I couldn’t even screen for help.  Thinking about it now, I am not half of the man I thought I was.  It’s embarrassing and pathetic. My eyes were starting to get used to the environment.  That’s when I saw a second individual behind the first one, between 2 trees about 25 meters.  If you ask me what I was thinking at that time, I would say: - I don’t. I wasn’t able to hold even one thought in my mind or make reason of the situation I was in but I was well aware that it was an encounter. I heard a lot of stories about abducted people and crops.  I always thought that it would be nice if were true but for me, it was nothing but a good story.  But now days I think to myself: those were really brave people that were capable to make a reason of the situation and analyze the circumstances or it’s a complete hoax.  Either way, I never thought that my body and mind would give up on me so bad. The worst part for me was the staring.  Those big \"black shiny\" eyes were so indifferent, so cold,...I can’t explain.  One thing I know for sure.  Those eyes saw right through me. I tell you why. I don’t really know how long it took until I heard a voice saying:  Come down now! My head has steady facing those individuals at all times like a cat hunting a mouse.  My full attention was to those two standing before me but I didn’t saw no lip moving.  I looked around real quick and I heard again:  No harm will come to you.  Come down now.  That’s when I realize that the voice was I my head. Without even realize, I start putting some order in my thoughts.  My shock state has start been replaced by reason.  Until this point, my head was a mess.  I can’t tell how long time had passed since I first spot the first individual and I didn’t paid attention at all on the light anymore.  I felt like if I took my eyes off the subject something bad would happen to me.  Slowly, I stood up and took a defense position. I start to look around for places where I could run.  My legs stopped shaking but my shoulder and hand were killing me. I look at my hand and I saw a lot of blood.  I cut my hand deep when I felt and also mess up my shoulder. I tried to stop the bleeding by holding the cut with my other hand.  While I was attending my hand I heard the voice again:  No harm will come to you.  Until that point I haven’t replied a word but this time I asked: what you want from me?  The voice replied: To teach. I never knew if just one of them were talking to me or both.  The voice was always the same tone.  It never changed. The following is a series of questions and answers that followed my first reply:  Me (after a short moment of reflection, I said -always using my own voice-): I  do not understand and I am scared to death.  What do you want to teach me?  Voice:   No harm will come to you. I am here to answer your questions.  I am here to show you our ways. I couldn’t think of anything to ask besides what regards my safety and situation.  Then I asked: Me: If you mean no harm to me, can I go home now?  Voice: I am no more alien to you that you are to me. I am here to help you.  To guide you.  I cannot force you to see what I want to show you. In that very moment, the second individual backed up and disappeared in the dark.  The one standing in front of me took a few steps back.  A heavy silence stroke the air. I asked:  Me:  What will happen to me if I choose to see what you want to show me?  Voice: No harm will come to you.  I will show you our way.  I will guide you. Me:  Will I be allowed to go home after that? Voice: Yes. At the same moment, the second individual appeared and joined the first one. I looked around again hoping that somebody would show up…the voice said: This way. As they turned around and started walking deep in the hoods heading to the light’s direction, I could clearly see for the first time the anatomy of those individuals. Unlike us, it seems that they try to balance the head while walking which gave me the impression that they push the neck back and direct the head down in order to look straight. It looks creepy. We walked 300 meters (approximately) towards the light. I avoided looking up because I didn’t want to be blinded and lose sight of my surroundings. There was a platform like thing ahead. I hesitated. The two individuals stepped on the platform and turned to me. I headed: This way. My story begins here. Before I start I must state that I don’t really care what you think my story it’s a lie or true. I still have my life to take care, my bills to pay, my reputation as professional to keep and a social life to attend.  I won’t compromise my life to satisfy your ego or curiosity. It’s for you to decide what to believe. It’s for you to decide how to deal with what I’m about to tell you. We live our lives based on what we think it’s true and based on our own sense of justice. Because of that, we rage wars against whatever contradicts what we think its right. What if your truth it’s an illusion created to deceive you, to control what you think? I put all these conflicts behind and now I’m just trying to have a good life and enjoy every second of it. I truly don’t care if people kill each other over oil, money or whatever because, in my opinion, we are a no more than a cancer for this planet. We are not even able to understand each other and organize like cancer cells does. That put us lower as viruses. How pathetic. Anyway, my opinion counts for nothing and that’s not why you are reading this so let’s move on. I walked into the platform keeping my distance from those individuals. I guess they were prepared or experienced of dealing with primitive civilizations such as ours (comparing to theirs). There was in no moment pressure or treat on their part against me but I could tell that they didn’t trust me too which is completely understandable. he platform started lifting toward the light. As we approached, I could see the craft’s “belly”. It has triangle shape, dark colored (maybe because was night), and the strong lights were coming from something that looked like half spheres placed along the corners plus one right above us. Unlike the lights on the corners, the light above us was like blue neon but not strong enough to blind the eyes. Actually, that particular light didn’t affect my eyes at all. We float into the air for about 20 to 30 meters, just above the tree top. Once we got onboard, the blue light faded until shut complete off. The first thing I saw was one more individual standing on the edge of the platform, just like it was waiting for our arrival. I started to shake again thinking to myself how stupid I was for been there. At the same moment I heard the voice saying: No harm will come to you. That’s when I realized that they could listen to my thoughts. I asked them how come they could go into my head and talk to me. They answer that they can’t communicate with me if I choose not to listen. It said that nothing can be imposed. The following sentence was: This way. The compartment we arrived was rounded and the walls were just dark. There were 2 entrances in front of me and a bigger on the other side. They the 2 entrances had no doors but the bigger one was closed with the same material as the wall. I could tell it was a door because of the void in the wall. I don’t know for sure though. We took the right entrance. Two of them in front of me and one on my back. I’ve never felt so uncomfortable on my entire life. In this corridor, we passed through 3 other entrances closed by similar material as the wall. There were no symbols of ornaments anywhere. By this time, my body was hurting so much and my hand kept bleeding. I was really tired. We enter a room which has a table like thing which I was asked to sit. Two of them entered the room along with me but one of them followed the corridor. One of them took my hand and pointed a pen like instrument towards my wound. I felt like getting an electrical shock so I pulled my hand away. As I looked at my wound cleaning the blood using my shirt, it was fully closed and a small scar replaced the wound. I was amazed. Once more, it pointed the instrument on my shoulder and the pain was gone (after the shock, of course). As it returned the instrument to its original position, I heard: This way. I stood up fully recovered. I was no longer tired plus I felt my body was lighter. As I followed the two individuals, I came to realize that they also no longer had trouble walking. My conclusion was that the craft environment provides a lower gravity allowing the body to waste less energy. Again, this was my conclusion. All of them looked exactly the same just like a copy of each other. They were wearing metal like filters although I don’t think it was metal. We went out of the room back to the corridor. After 3 entrances closed by doors, we turned left which leaded to another corridor. This time, it wasn’t so dark. I could see some sort of device on the left wall spreading to its entire length. It had some small blinking lights on it but nothing fancy. I didn’t count how many doors we passed by for I was looking the device on the other side of the wall but the corridor lead to a wider room where another 2 individuals were sitting on something like chairs. There were control panels on the front wall which was rounded in just one side. The panels where transparent and full of symbols draw by light, very different of our standard monitors. Their hand movements were always slow. My best guess it that they don’t used their bodies randomly like we do by making sports or other activities. Every time they talked to me, there were no movements at all. No gestures or lip moving, nothing at all. Suddenly, the wall and floor became transparent like glass. I was able to see the moon and the city’s lights below us. That’s when I realize that the craft’s position had changed and we were no longer at the beach and no longer at low altitude. I didn’t felt a thing. As we slowly flew across the city below (I think it was Hachinohe but it’s impossible to tell), something happened. The two individuals sitting on their chairs pointed to dots of light on the east pin-pointed at the wall. The view just zoomed like you zoom your video camera but in high quality image. I recognized by shape two F-16s approaching fast. The image zoomed back to normal then suddenly, all the wall images faded into a dark blue and soon into black with bright dots everywhere. It took less than 2 seconds.  We were in space!  My perplexity was broken by the voice saying: Listen carefully for you are in danger. I took a second to react. I was about to ask it how come but it starts its speech: -\\tThe universe is a cycle of life.  Life is re-engineered at the end of each cycle. During each cycle, new species are created and develop conscience but at the end of the cycle, those consciences are destroyed to allow new species and conscious to rise. Only those species capable of organizing and learn will be allowed to go through the next cycle. My specie was allowed to continue through the next cycle by understanding the rules of the universe and its compositions. You are not prepared to continue through the next cycle. You will be destroyed. I was shocked. Those bastards lied to me by telling me “no harm will come to you”. I felt anger and I hated myself for been so stupid. Then I said: - I thought that no harm will come to me. That’s why I am here. To learn. Not to be destroyed! The voice continued: -\\tOur mission it’s to find species capable of communication and teach them the rules of the universe. No harm will come to you. That’s when I realized that it was referring me as a human been, not as individual. My head exploded with questions but it continued. Throughout time, we came to you to teach and to guide. We showed you how the universe works and teach about the stars. We send one of our own throughout time in order to live among you and teach our ways. And yet, you still fail to understand. I interrupted it by asking how come I never heard of another species teachings on my planet. It replies: -\\tWe sent one of our own through one of your vessels. A vessel is no more than a transport as machines are a way to enhance the vessel. I interrupted it again by asking:  - Why am I in danger? Why telling me this? What can I do? -\\tThe end of the cycle has come. We will help those who have learn our ways as we did to those we teach how to build. No harm will come to those who are willing to understand and learn. A few seconds were filled by silence. Then I ask: - Even if I am aware of this, what difference could I possible make?  Who will believe my story?  Why can’t you land your craft before the crowds and make your point yourself? -\\tNothing can be imposing. We have a pact with your species that allow us to contact you individually but not public in exchange of technology. We will no longer come back until the cycle ends. When it does, we will help those who can be saved. No harm will come to you. My interest of their technology or the craft itself disappeared completely.  It wouldn’t even reply all my questions properly. Without even realizing what’s were going around me, I looked to the wall and I saw city lights. We were on Earth again. I heard: This way. We walked back to the corridor, just back to the rounded room where we arrived. I was dropped 30 km away from where my car was parked. My clock has dead, my mobile dead but I had money enough to take a cab. I never spoke a word about what happen that night and I never went back to that beach alone again, especially at night time. This is my story.  Feel free to discard or do publish it but do not try to locate or contact me in any way.  I will not discuss this in public.

       "       'sighting in northern ireland and possible abduction.. ongoing   Myself and i keep having reoccurring memories about a sighting we both believe it is true and we always put it down to a dream, thing is it cant be a dream about the same thing on the same night.. every time we see something about ufo sightings it gives us weird feelings.. a programme on national  geo channel TV has us worried. it tells of a sighting in Arizona in 1997 about a v shape craft..  we don’t remember a shape as such but when it told of glowing red orbs moving too and from the big thing we just looked at each other in shock.. this is something about what we had both experienced but failed to remember.. this is very real.. what we both agree on is we cannot remember the date, we both agree it was from our back garden at our last address, we looked out over our fence it was dark but not pitch dark more like late dusk or early dawn, a little pink or red tinge to the sky.. i recall to her come here quick what the hell is this come quick some shape about! my 1 o’clock position and about 45 degrees.. by the time she came to see a lot of other red orb lights moving into its area and out from it there where lots  i remember shouting woooh did you see that!!! i cant remember what i saw now, i somehow think it was two orbs colliding and becoming one, but as we speak about it now Michele remembers this also.. I also remember saying quick we better check the news, there was a fear of we where being invaded..  there is something chilling about this encounter and as time goes on we are constantly reminded of things, little pieces of this puzzle come back to us with startling reality..  we also have had another dream at the same time as we slept and when we woke in morning we told the same thing to each other that there was something with long fingers coming to get us, we both put it down to Freddy crougar type nightmare..   this Freddy crougar dream happened in my fiancée’s house five years ago. this airborne vision was only 3years a! go .. there was no sound we can remember.. I think 1’m going m! ad.. I u sed to have a good memory , now I feel my short time memory has had something done to it and also I find facial recognition hard  in my short term memory ..I am beginning to think I’ve been brain washed. I periodically have dreams that something is at me or coming for me and I cannot open my eyes, I keep fighting this to no avail . eventually I can open my eyes  . these dreams come on for no reason, I feel helpless and I cannot move no matter how hard I try, its like my eyes are glued shut but I am conscious and aware of something being there. Please let me know if anyone else has experienced these things as we have and I still do..  I was an auto technician until I hurt myself in an accident, I have an average education, I have all these things in my head about stuff I should know nothing about, I have emailed professor Stephen Hawking about these things,, I am yet to have a satisfactory answer, I have also emailed Ronald Mallett, Professor at the University of Connecticut.. I have yet to get a reply. I  do not know why I know this stuff or at least know how to question the things I do, I am no physicist.  yours sincerely',\n",
       "       '2 UFOs over a truck stop. I was a trucker and drove throughout north america.  I was parked at the truck stop in .... over night.  I went to sleep around 2130 and shortly after found myself aboard a craft that was white with a blue stripe.  There were windows on both sides but I dont remember seeing any passengers from the outside.  I was within 20 feet of it.  It was shaped like a passenger jet complete with a rudder from the side but had no wings when viewed from the ground underneath the craft. This was the craft I went inside.  The other craft was sguare, like a platform.  There were many beings inside some looked very human but others were quite pale.  They were normal height, all under 5-6 i would think.  We all communicated telepethically.  They were friendly.  I knew this not just because they appeared friendly but i could communicate openly with their minds or at least the mind of the one I assume was the leader.  He was the one who communicated with me anyway.  I never did ! remember everything that happened that night.  I do recollect that part of my memory was erased.  I was made aware of this.  As well it was I believe 19 years ago and my memory isnt that great.  I do remember that i had the propulsion system explained to me in some detail.  I was always interested in mechanical things and this craft was powered by some form of hydrogen.  in the fog they could run forever without fuel by taking in water from the air.  It was a very foggy spring that year.  They showed me 2 fuel tanks that appeared to be white poly.  They were around 2 and a half gallons.  They told me how far they could go on one of these tanks of water, it was very impressive but i dont remember the distance.  They showed off a little bit with the blue and white vessel.  The maneuvers it did were quite impressive.  I was standing beside my truck while they did figure eights over my head.  I became conscious that I was sitting in the cab of my truck on the edge of my bunk.  ! I dont recall how I got there.  It was around 330.  I dont like to call it an abduction.  It was more like a friendly visit.  My diesel was idling all the time this occured.  That is all I am willing to share at this time.',\n",

I had been sleeping in our \"Smoker Craft.\" ( On it\\'s Trailer) Upon Sitting up I looked to my Southeast & Noticed for the first time a very large mountain only about 1 mile from where we had parked in complete DARKNESS FACING THE RESVOIR.( I could NOT SEE MY HAND IN FRONT OF MY FACE; Without Artificial lighting! As I looked above the mountain, I recall first seeing a Platinum semi sphere the size of the ENTIRE MOUNTAIN, but it rose over an approximate 3 minute Period! At this time the Silent stationary OBJECT WAS AT LEAST 3X\\'s the Size of the Full Moon! Alarmed by my inability to explain what I had already whitnessed; I then woke Jim Y. He and I observed this object for what seemed to be ten to fifteen minutes. The now complete Mercury/Quick-Silver Full Circle could be seen, in TOTAL SILENCE!\\xa0  What I don\\'t understand is why after speaking to Jim, to wake him: Why he or I spoke nothing about it the next morning?  WHY WE DID NOT WAKE MY BROTHER SLEEPING IN THE BED OF THE TRUCK, to Also view SUCH AN INCREDIBLE SIGHTING!\\xa0   I know I felt like I had a dream, because it took nearly a year or two after this sighting to RECALL ANYTHING!  I almost felt like I had been given the Out-Patient Valium type of drug called Versedt!   I only RECALLED THIS EVENT WHEN AT OUR CABIN SOME YEAR OR SO LATER!  The first time I made what would be one of 3-4 sightings over a 2-year period.  I was putting out the Campfire about 2:45 in the morning alone.\\xa0   I.

All three-4 sightings were witnessed by: ((names deleted))...(older Brother to Daren E. But they are half bros. Their Sir names end in \"l\" and Differ by ((names deleted))...my last name after we were married in 1996. V. Description of the Almost Identical sightings:  Azimuth 115 degrees/ but facing due north looking almost 85 degrees in Elevation( I took Meterology & I had just place my RCA Direct tv dish in the first summer of it\\'s release) I have also taken General Astronomy, as well as Dead Reconning/ Cartographical Navigation. Almost every sighting seemed to be on an exact time an Schedule: The observations would begin at 02:30/02:45 and 0:4:50ish with a duration of between 15-1hr...dunno if longer because I randomly would either go out in the middle of the night or early morning to find what looked like three stars, but brighter. They would almost appear straight-up in the North or Northwest direction. These objects would start in a straight-line, evenly spaced at at least 16-19 miles high, because sometimes, I could see the Atmospheric \"Sparkle\"\"Twinkle\" Effects. This on clear nights. The sighting would progress greatly in movement and bright-flashes. The \"Formation\" would then increase to about nine evenly spaced objects. Each evenly spaced, equal in size luminosity. They would then either rotate 45 Degrees to the left or Right, forming a Osciles Triangle instantaniously, with no perceived time lapse between each munuever. The addition of the six oringinally seemed to just turn on like a Distant white LED. The ojects would then shoot an \"ARGON\" Green LASER between them. Then it would discontinue in about 10-15 Seconds, then the nine would form a straight line Array. Repeat, then Rotate another 45 degrees withouth changing the Over-All location in the sky by more than the total Estimated Six inches in the Sky. But if one applied the change in angles in the Sky observed from the ground at 7,400 feet; One would deduce they were moving up to 6\" @ 19 miles or easily Two hundred miles per second, or other arrays were already in place and then were activated? Either way the speed would be 200 plus miles per non perceived time o! r moment! The other alternative is this \"Array\" that made triangles rt,isoc...Circles and then either a total \"Wink-Out or on one instace I did see on then leave West covering from about 85 degrees to 15 Degrees Behind/Below Horizon in about 3.3 Seconds( I counted one one thousand two one thousand ecetera) [ the array would be literally hundreds of miles in area?]   Other deductions or findings:   A. I believed I was watching Ronald Reagan\\'s \"Star Wars, but since have been apprised that our Technology did NOT HAVE THESE ABILITIES IN THE EARLY 1990\\'s!   B. I had no reason to look up / wake the first time at either location! No sounds or ANYTHING SEEMED MORE THAN SATELITTES THE SECOND TIME.

       "       \"Possible UFO abduction,  It was about 9:30 pm when I went into the garage, and I noticed a large light beam emitting from the ceiling, I thought it was a huge hole coming through the roof, so I went to my roommates room to tell him about the hole.  He dismissed the sighting, and turn away from me to go to sleep.   Before, I knew it, I spoke aloud, saying you don't want to see what I am seeing.  A sphere entered through the bedroom room, and then a second one entente red, then one more.   The first sphere hovered next to me and then moved around the bed to my roommate's side.  The second sphere hovered next to me, and I said, leave me alone, I'm tired.  Leave Me alone.   The sphere began to emit different brilliant colors all remaining inside the sphere, and then it moved over to the other side of the bed, filling the third sphere, and the fourth.  Suddenly, I heard my roommate screaming, my back, oh god my back.   I fell back on the bed, I could not move, or see what was happening to him! . .  I was put out hearing my friend 's screams.   We both woke up 12 hours later, we both just popped up into a sitting position as the exact same moment.  The sphere were white dense and hovered, except the one that contained the multi brillant colors. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting in March 1998 is approximate.

So please give me the phone number that you would use because I never answer any calls without id, or name, or leave a message and i will return your call.  I will have to speak to my friend.  It happened here in Los Osos , CA.  the on 15th street, My friend is not brave, however I am to the extreme.   I rarely fear anything.  He just covered his body with a sheet as to hide and I spoke to them, possibility making them upset with me by telling them not to bother me.  It happened in March 1998, but to be certain I need to check with my friend for the exact date.  He tells me that he thinks of it everyday, it haunts him.   I expect them again, I'm an artist, and the alien seeminglly becomes part of my work.,   He did get hypnotized and recorded the session, listened to it and when he got home it had been erased, how he doesn't understand.   He was abducted.   I'm thinking about going to a hypnotist myself unless you can do this for me.   Looking forward to hearing from you.  thank you for your response.

       "       \"I bet it was that Chupacabra from the 80's that I saw flying this want to be Dish UFO Went outside to the garbage to throw away garbage and saw a light thinking an bright star. The star looking to be moving but was not sure.  But it was moving.  Then was far from distance coming towards moving slow. As I was watching I called someone to come outside and see this light in the distance. They told me there doing something and I told them to hurry up. I watched it slowing getting closer. Thinking at times it looks like the light is sun gleaming on the object or is it a orb or something. Told them hurry up get out here now before you miss it looking sorta high in sky or not no chinese lantern. Then witness who i been saying get outhere comes out side as the light got closer and said something like it might be a Dish I don't think it's a plane no sound. Then a blinking plane flew past it above it the light then got out of seeing range for about 10 seconds. Then got over and see it again go past us and notices a very small tiny dot behind it blink onc! e evey 10 seconds but my witness could not see what I was saying. No sound,no blinking light in front but may have blinking light in back that blinks every 10 seconds that you can barely even see. Witness say he could not see the blink that I was talking about. It kept down 99th street sorta. It was getting dimmer the farther it was going as I could see other planes lights clearly as the planes were father than this light. It was around 8:06 to 8:12pm. It was dark around I think 6:30pm so think maybe the sun was glaring on object. But behind the object as it was going past has a very slow blink light on it. I don't think Dishes have a Blink light on it? Witness think its was a dish with a blink light behind it. It was no Jet,or no plane. Oak Lawn i seen stuff in past. Weird because I was just reading about Betty and Barny the ones who got abducted story. I saw the back of light blink very lightly every 10 seconds as it was passing after around 4 mintues and 35 seconds but t! he witness could not see that. I see stuff like weird simmular! before but behind object light had maybe a beacon blink really slow that blends in too much with the sunlight glare. Moved in a 33 degree anlge going straight. Just kidding why would that Chupacabra from the 80's want to come back to boring Oak Lawn. Happy Halloween.

       "       'very low flying, silencing, and silent UFO. This was my third UFO sighting. It took place in August 2006. I figured this would be my last or at least my best sighting. I was arriving home from a late class; it was probably around 9:30 to 9:45pm. Everything had gone normally on my 40 mile drive from the community college back to my small town. I had the windows down because it was a warm summer night. To the west of us are several lagoons and a creek, to the east our fields are low and damp most of the summer, thus frogs are loud, very loud all the way up until the first frost. As soon as I turned on to the three-quarter miles of dirt road to my house I was welcomed by the familiar sound of the frogs.  I listened to them, turning off my music before I rolled up my windows and got out.  As soon as I was stepping out of my car onto the driveway, all of the frogs, on either side of our house went entirely silent. It was terribly frightening, as I had lived here all my life and had occasionally heard the frogs in our field stop croaking with the obvious intrusion of a predator. The same went for the occasional silence from the creek behind by neighbors to the west of us. But, I had NEVER heard the frogs from the lagoon stop croaking, not to mention all three locations at once, or even two of them at once.  I don’t really know what made me do it, but trying to locate to source of the suddenly palpable tension from all the life in the woods, (did I mention EVERYTHING stopped making noise, no crickets, no owls, no loons, nothing), I looked up.  Out of my four, maybe five, sightings, I have never been so scared. It was so low. Likely only 200 feet or so from the ground, as it was only 100 feet or so above our 90 foot trees. It scared me so badly I froze, as it was over me when I looked up, but not hovering, rather moving very slowly from the west towards the east. It was so close I could very clearly see its shape. I don’t really know what to call the shape without drawing it. It was very rounded at the font and came to three points at the back. I was directly beneath it so could not see its cabin, but there was a single two-part bright white light in its center and absolutely no landing gear, not even a seam.  I don’t know how to explain what I called the “two-part” light. They were square lights, and right next to each other, vertically on the craft, but the one nearer the front of the craft was brighter.  It was not pointing its light at me or at anything really. It was just moving, very, very slowly towards the east. It’s speed was so incredibly slow and it was so low that I actually began panicking after I realized not only had it caused all of the animals to silence, IT made NO NOISE, absolutely nothing, not a hum, not a buzz, not even rustling the leaves in the trees.  As soon as my fear of being abducted passed and it was nearing the edge of the forest I ran straight for the house without looking back. I told my parents directly and was shaking with panic. I still want to say “It was INSANE!” I have no idea what it was. Last year or two years ago, when the military finally admitted to having a Black Manta, I thought that was what it would be. But I’ve seen a Manta, and read of it. It says it’s 60 feet wide and 30 feet long. What I saw was not a triangle, but a half a circle (sort of), with three points on the back. It was likely only 20 feet wide, maybe 20 to 25 feet long.  It was most notably, silent, seamless, and slow moving, and strange that the light didn’t seem overly bright since it was so close. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))',\n",
       "       'St. Charles, off MO-94 (Friedens Rd), three triangle shaped white lights hover above the road Last night, I was heading to a bonfire in St. Charles, off 70W and MO-94, and just as I pulled onto the dark street the directions were leading me to, I saw two bright white lights (I think the third was obscured) they were so far away from each other, they could easily be mistaken for stars, however they moved in sync with each other and hovered there straight above of where I was heading, very low to the ground.  The craft was huge!  I got scared and u-turned and didn’t look back.  I drove the 20 minutes home and called and told my friends I was too tired to go out--which wasn’t fun because I had really wanted to go to see my friend, R., who was in town just for one night.  The spaceship is the only reason I didn’t make it to the bonfire. I have had 4 or 5 previous sighting with this kind of craft.  It is a UFO to me because I don’t know what can hover like that and I have seen them zigzag through the night sky out of sight in a split second; it could very well be a government aircraft, but since my government has not informed me of such things (as they should if they have them!) it may also be alien spacecraft.  I have seen one over the ocean in North Carolina that backed behind a cloud and came back (this was a GIANT black craft, still the three white lights on the ends---there was a government base nearby I know), one when I was traveling from Kansas to St. Louis down 70 E near Colombia (this looked exactly like the one from last night, except that when I first noticed it, there was a sort of spotlight coming from it I thought it was a soccer field spotlight at first, this one stayed with me on my drive down 70 for  a while), I have seen one at camp Zoe, MO (far off in the night sky and zigzags across in ! irregular patterns and then darted across to the right in less than a second.  This one looked different than the others and the lights looked like white-then-blue-then-red or a combination of the three colors, my guess for this is the far distance away the light were),  I briefly saw the red-blue-white lights in a triangle shape also on highway 70 going west about three years ago, (this one also disappeared very quickly). I would love to know what it is I am seeing these last three years.  I have only seen triangle-shaped with three lights on the ends.  I have reason to believe that each of them have a see-through hole directly in the middle of the triangle (my ex boyfriend saw one very close up in daylight).  I don’t want to be abducted but I also don’t want to be scared.  I always tell myself I will be brave next time I see them but I am not yet very brave when I am alone (like last night).   Hopefully, I will run into them with my boyfriend so he can see and also so we can be together if anything were to happen.  Optimistically, they are our friends in the sky that just want to say hello and see what going on with the humans these days.',\n",
       "       'Orange Orbs on multiple nights and finally a large Mother ship also Orange. Orange Orbs March 14 2011   I am an avid sky watcher.  I want to make that point clear.  Since my first sighting in 1979 I have been quietly obsessed with our universe and the many cultures that abound throughout.  I want also to be clear that I rarely ever report what I see to anyone other than my friends and family. In August of 2010, I began to see Orange Orbs at fairly close range with the lot of my home either front or back yard being my vantage point.  The first one I saw was after sunset but prior to the dark of night.  While talking on the phone standing on my patio when, as if directed in some way, I turned my head and focused directly on the orange orb heading my direction and saw it clearly.  I told the person on the phone what I was witnessing, stating that this was a “good one”.  At best guess I would say the real size of the object was about 2 to 4 feet spherical.  The orange glow at least gave it the look of being spherical.  I figure it was at an altitude of 75 to 150 feet and maybe 200 yards downrange.  I always have binoculars on the table so I told my party I was reaching for them.  As I reached I knew that the orb was watching me.  I knew that it was reading my thoughts and when I grabbed the binoculars it, as best as I can describe, folded into thin air.  The total e! lapsed time was maybe 45 seconds. The next visit was just two evenings later.  This time I was in the front of my house.  While playing darts with my nephew, I received a phone call.  My dartboard is in the garage so I took my call to the driveway in the front of the house.  I am a pacer, especially when I talk on the phone: While pacing up and down my driveway, just like the last time, I was almost summoned to turn my head and look up.  I did and there it was again, the orange orb.  This time it was much closer to me.  It was visibly about three times the size of a basketball, slowly moving about twice the height of my one story rooftop, between my neighbor’s house and mine.  Again I told the party on the phone, “There is that orb again”.  “Wes check it out!”  (Wes is my nephew) I told him to hurry and grab those binoculars.  All the while I never took my eyes off of the orb.  It was communicating with me.  I could feel it.  And the moment Wes grabbed the binoculars and started toward me it, once again, fo! lded into thin air. This was two sightings in as many days and I could feel that the orb was aware of me and it knew that I was aware of it.  I might also mention that I have had a number of sightings; I have lunched with Bob Lazar at a pizza place in Vegas.  Been to black box road several times, and so on.  These were the first “Orbs” that I have witnessed.  Well three nights later I had another visit.  This time I was just pacing in the driveway waiting for my pup to handle her business when I, as if someone called my name turned and looked right at the hovering orb.  This time it was a good 200 feet in altitude and over the middle of my street.  I stared for about 10 seconds, pointed to it and said, “Please don’t disappear again.” And backed into the garage trying to keep my eyes fixed and at the same time reaching for my binoculars and at risk of sounding insane, I felt it smile and just like that it folded into the night sky again.  At this point I am sure that there is something big happ! ening.  I do not mean in general.  That is obvious.  I mean specifically with me.  I thought finally after all these years of trying to telepathically reach out, someone is picking up the cottin pickin phone. Nights   turned into weeks, they quickly turned into months.  Each night diligently going out to call to the orb while stargazing and nothing except for maybe one sighting about 1000 yards down the street and higher in altitude but I am only 70 percent sure that was the orb.  That is until tonight.  While playing darts again in my garage, I stepped to the driveway and pointed calling, “Dude, tell me you are seeing that.”  This was not the orb but a huge ship!  Much higher, I would say 1500 to 3000 feet in altitude, maybe 1.5 to 3 miles down range, and glowing like a mini sun but it was longer top to bottom then left to right, it split into 4 equal size large orbs that slightly angled toward the ground, then, immediately went back to one, back to two larger at an angle again back to 1 large round, then stretched upward and blipped out. I have witnessed some very awesome stuff.  This ranks in the top three for me of all time.  My nephew could not believe that finally after hearing me talk about ufos and aliens for years he finally saw that.  It was a short sighting but a very fantastic one.  Of course I checked out all of the obvious possibilities knowing full well that what we had seen was genuine.  I have seen almost the identical thing on a post on some website, and I believe it was a film from Norway.  I could be wrong on that.  Needless to say it was significant enough to warrant this report.  I would like to hear of the many comparisons that are out there.  I know that we are and have been visited here since the beginning.  My being is fully aware of the endosymbiotic relationship that we all share with one another, with our Creator, and with the Planet, Galaxy and the Universe.  I spend countless hours as a crack researcher from UFOs to Mars anomalies, to alien races, underground bases, and the whol! e lot of it.  I throw out most hang on to some and dig into others.  I have always had a connection with space for some reason, as a child I was so afraid of ufos I would not sleep in my room alone until about the 8th grade and that was in 1979 I think.  I do not think I was ever abducted at least I do not think I was.  I may be privy to something I am not yet aware of but that is yet to be revealed.  I have the gift of sight and can see things in people that freak me out still.  Most of my closest friends know me as “The Profit.”  I simply can see through some sort of window when prompted to do so. Anyway, I just felt compelled to put this one on the record.  I will continue to look for them every night and will report back if they continue.  If you are in the know keep digging, if you are skeptical, look up once in a while, you will eventually be shown. If you are a government official, I feel sorry for you.  Just kidding, but if you are, help bring full disclosure.  We as a race deserve the truth.  Peace to all and may your spirit find its source and one day know it.',\n",
       "       'Gig Harbor visitors and subsequent regression  500 Lights On Object0: Yes This sighting occurred on Reid Dr NW, Gig Harbor, WA. during October 1979.  My wife and one year old daughter were with me at the time.  As we approached the harbor drive, I noticed a large silver ship hovering above the trees.  We stopped and watched if for a few moments until it followed the tree line down to the Harbor and headed off across Puget Sound towards Mt. Rainier.  This was the subject of a regression done in Kennewick, WA. in 2009.   These were red/browns that pulled us into the craft.  They stated that they were in the neighborhood and just stopped by to say hello. They expressed pleasure at the fact that I had settled down and started a family.  Amazing.  There were two in sight.  The smaller one that held me as a child and a larger entity that was more fully developed and seemed to be in charge.  They also stated that there was something out there in our future coming our way.  This was the first sighting that I remembered and when I underwent regression, the hypnotist instructed me to go to the first sighting that I have ever had.  That abduction occurred when I was eleven years old while living in Westmont, N.J.   I was being shadowed by a Silvery craft while walking in a park near where we lived.  It was silvery with brassy portholes and about 25 feet in diameter.  It was hovering over the trees.  I suddenly felt myself being sucked up a hose type device and landing near a wall/shelf in a corner of the craft.  Something was off to my left rear.  I was afraid and turned my head down and away.  It took my left wrist in its hand and attempted to see into my face.  It was a red/brown entity that was about an inch taller than me.  It was very nurturing and concerned that I had been interfered with.  I have never felt threatened by these entities.  Angry, yes, but not threatening.

       "       'Gigantic Kingdome shaped craft with orb over front yard   This experience happened in late June 1986 while living Shelton, WA, at the end on an inlet.  I had showered and immediately stepped into bed.   Around 3:15 AM I awoke to see an orb hovering above the deck and just outside of our bedroom door.  I had an ominous feeling about this sighting.  My children were in the bed room behind me.  The object was brassy in color with flat ends, although shaped somewhat like a football.  I reached behind me for the .357 magnum that was in the headboard.  The weapon was hot loaded and had a trigger safety.  Something was about to get used for target practice. I awoke in an upright position at about 4:45 AM.  It was light out.  I went into the kitchen and made myself a cup of coffee and sat down on the base of the fireplace when I noticed oily spots on my feet.  I knew that I had been out side, but I could not remember anything.  This experience would also be the subject of a regression in 2009.  They walked me into the yard where I noticed a bright light and an absolutely gigantic craft sliding over me.  It was hundreds of feet in diameter.  I felt seriously outgunned.  They sucked me up and took me for a ride.  These entities were red/brown and there were about a dozen of them.  They were extremely angry at me. They felt that I had a very bad attitude. They gave me the cold shoulder and I can remember watching stars blow by in a blinding blur. The dog that I had picked up on the beach was a special gift to teach me how to love.  I did make a number of changes in my life after this abduction. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))',\n",
       "       '9 --11 rusty red bands of light materialize and then dematerialize in stages above work roof  On the Friday,  August 29,2003. While in Scarborough,Ontario at work there. I came outside for a smoke break at about 1:10pm. The day was quite warm and clear blue sky with a slight haze high above. Within about five minutes while observing the sky above my workroof -facing north. Three red rusty round lights  \"materialized\" over my work roof at about roughly less  than one thousand feet in altitude. These lights than changed in size and shape that formed a longer \"band\" in shape. In description they appeared in length maybe 20-50 ft long-in a vertical position  In width would be about 5-10 feet. They were a bright  \"rusty \" red light with a obvious light intensity. I then screamed for a coworker near by to come out and see this display after about  one minute. As the coworker came out and looked up above the roof.He also could see the display of unknown aerial light anomalies. After about 10-15 seconds. We together observed three more appear from nowhere into the group of three. Now the count being six light anomalies above in total. Then after another 30 seconds. Another three-five bands of light materialized before our eyes. Now there are 9 or as many in total 11. Both I and the witnessed were quite in a state of shock in what we were witnessing. Now as we watched this group of rusty red bands of light just sitting still in a  group of 9 bands -maybe 11. It happened so fast in this stunning spectale to observe. Within about 40 seconds later. A small white LOW flying commerical jet came in the direction where these light  anomalies were stationary. Here comes the shocker to this observation of the pure bizarre. As the jet came directly at the light anomalies. These bands of light together moved ahead slowly, as one group forward towards us. The ones in front dematerialized -like going through a invisible door. The rest still visable followed all in about 10 -15 seconds and vanished before our eyes. This happened as before the jet flew directly at them where they once were sitting. My coworker was totally in shock, as he went back inside the workplace. I stayed outside for another 10 minutes and witnessed nothing more. I looked for the witness in our place of work. He was indeed in a DEEP state of shock. He did NOT want to talk about it ANY FURTHER what he witnessed with me. One thing to note that the following work day on Monday -he could not talk. As if he lost his voice. PLEASE NOTE: At the end of the day to go home there was another TYPE of intense white plasma light sighting directly above following me in the car. I will send this to you, as it is another separate report that should be told. It was one of the strangest sightings I\\'ve ever witnessed. Sorry it took this long to report this sheer paranormal sighting observed to you. I truly believe this sighting confirms another type of  \"level\" of higher intelligence. ie Craft not included -they did not appear solid. I have to question the timing of the jet \\'s presence also. Added with it\\'s low altitude over my roof. Did someone know that fast of a possible contact/abduction about to happen on the ground ?  Very strange event to witness for anybody.',\n",
       "       \"Kingman disc   This event occurred on April 15, 2010, in the rear of the KOA Park in Kingman Arizona.  I was waiting outside for my wife to retrieve a camera for a photo for use as a contributor in a book being written by Brad Steiger.  We had recently retired, and were in Kingman to pick up a 5th wheel RV. Upon looking up at a cloud less sky, I could see a silver disc ascending away from me at a slow pace. By the time my wife arrived with the camera it was almost imperceptible. There was no sound or emissions from the craft. This was five days before the BP Gulf oil blow out. I was missing 3-4 minutes of time. In July, this abduction was the subject of a regression conducted by a hypnotist in Kennewick, WA. This is one of many abductions that have occurred since my childhood. These entities (star people) are red/brown. They expressed serious anger over that blowout which was already underway. On January 12th 2011 while on a trip to Parker, AZ., from where we are currently staying, I found myself missing 30-35 minutes on a 15 mile trip. This will be the subject of a future regression.  Due to the substantial amount of missing time, I fear for the worst. Additional information is available at my blog:  http://destroyedbyoil.blogspot.com/ ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS))   Sorry, I had no idea what to do.  I am sure it is the sight.  I will attach the photos.  I brought back some of the battery parts and light bars to the house.  I found this spot about 2 years ago but no one I spoke to was interested.  If you are I will be happy to help you with location and everything.  I believe it was Stancil that drew the picture I will include first.  The 2nd one is a photo of the rocks closer up.  If you are in the area you will see it as Stancil did.  Photos 2,3 and 4 are of the battery parts left laying there over the years.  The 5th one is the light bars that that are talked about by Stancil and everyone else at the site.  Be more than happy to go get more pictures if you are interested.  The sight is only a few miles from Kingman, AZ.  If there is anything else you want from me please let me know.  I think it is important for people that are interested to know that this really did take place.  Later, ((name deleted)) ((END ADDENDUM #1)) ((BEGIN ADDENDUM #2))   It is not of alien origin.  It is what was left after the military left.  They did not clean up well.  The picture that Stancil drew and the area North of Kingman.  The batteries and light bars that have been there for at least 50 years to decompose and rust as they have.  I KNOW what it is and I guess that is all that is important.  I'm not looking for any recognition or anything.  I only thought someone would like to know.  Thank you for your time. ((END ADDENDUM #2))\",\n",
       "       'We were in a look out called the saltese hills, star gazing because there had already been quite a few weird things in the sky that night.  We were standing outside the car when my fiance pulled me down underneath it.  It was only about 250 feet above us, triangular with a strobing kind of head light.  Totally silent with orbs of light glowing beneath it.  We could clearly make out the workings of the ship.  We saw it land in the dry lake area called the \"saltese flats\" where it gathered quite a bit of fog and then rose back into the air, and flying literally back into space it seemed.  Then 3 stars that had always been in the sky came together in a triangular formation and took off after it.  My fiance and I will never be the same and it was probably one of the more traumatic experiences of my life. Spokane is a hot spot, people. Since what we call the encounter we\\'ve purchased the best binoculars we can afford and often times the \"helecoptors\" we see in the sky are actually triangular ships with the lights made to look like helecoptors.  We see crazy shit every night and wonder if we\\'re the only ones watching. Someone needs to get to Spokane to check this stuff out because, as I said, it\\'s every night. My fiance and a couple of our friends that grew up in the area \"green acres\" are recently sure they\\'ve been abducted as children, and now again as adults, myself included. Too many coincidences.  All the same experience.  Hypnosis involved with discovery as well as natural memory recovery.  Half the time we feel like we\\'re losing our minds until we remember that we\\'re sane people and this stuff is really happening.  Local authorities thing we\\'re bad shit crazy, but oh well. We would LOVE to be contacted by you guys so at least then we could get some answers.',\n",
       "       'On February  18, 2011, at approximately 8:30 PM, my boyfriend and I were parked at a horse stable down the street from my secluded neighborhood deep inside Carbon Canyon in California.  We were facing a hill, just chatting before he had to leave for work.  We also talked about aliens, abductions, or just anything that\\'s fun enough to talk about.  We were discussing 2012, transcendence into space, etc.  Right in front of us, in perfect view, the brightest flash of light I\\'ve ever seen was in the sky.  My boyfriend looked behind him, thinking it was a police officer or someone flashing a light on us--haha-- and I was fixated on the light.  It was a pretty big circle, with blue/green lights in a perfect circle, with a big light in the middle of it.  It flashed a few times, then all the lights came together and it left. It was a cloudy night, and definitely was not lightening, but similar.  The lights were the craziest part to me.  It looked like northern lights. Whatever was the in sky was there long enough for me to shout, \\'What is that?!\\' \"oh my god, aliens? what are those crazy bright lights?!\" and then I got out of the car, heart racing, and watched it leave. I tried looking online for reports, twitter updates, etc.  The only thing I got was this  olliepires  Either it\\'s a UFO or lightening in my backyard    AlexI3eck WTF WAS THAT THING IN THE SKY?! UFO WITH @CALLIMARIE!!! ball lightening?!?',\n",
       "       \"My husband and I didn't believe in UFO's until we actually saw one! It was a warm summer evening, around 7:30 P.M.  My husband was home and my babies were in their cribs sleeping.   I went to the bathroom window to remove my clothes off the clothesline.  I had to stand on the edge of the tub to take in my clothes, and in the far off skyline, I noticed a very large orange sun which meant it was going to be very hot the next day.   I stopped what I was doing and looked at the sky, and  admired it.  Often in the daytime, when hanging out my clothes, when it was clear out, I could actually see the top of the Empire State Bldg.   Anyway, as I looked at the skyline, I noticed blinking lights, and the object was zig zagging coming closer and closer.  It was quite far away, so it was small, and the closer it got, the more curious I became.   I went into the hallway of our apartment building and went up to the roof.  As I watched the object get closer and closer, I called out to my husband and he came up to the roof.  As the object came closer, we could see it was silver and it looked like there were lights of different colors going round and round, like the top of a police vehicles light.   I ran down and got my neighbor and she came up and we looked up in the sky.  As the object approached us, it kind of tilted and it then looked like a round shaped disk, and the sound it emitted was a swishing sound.   It cam around and went to the left of  us, and it stopped.  When it stopped, the swishing sound stopped and their was a humming sound like a motor.  I noticed windows in the center of the object, and what we thought were different colored panes, was instead, there was some sort of lights changing colors and it was rotating inside of the craft.   We noticed then two rods, on each end of the craft.  They were facing downwards.  We looked up mesmerized and we asked each other if we could figure out what it was, and we were just dumfounded.   After what seemed like 10 or 15 mins. the rods disappeared and the object which had become an oval shape took off zig zagging and wit! hin seconds it disappeared from sight.  When the object took off, the motor stopped and there was a swishing sound.  We were dumbfounded.   We went down to our apartment, my neighbor who didn't speak English, but Italian, I spoke with her as that is my language and she said she never saw anything like it.   My husband went into one room and I in another and we both drew what we saw.  We drew the identical thing.   We decided to call the Civil Aironautics Bureau, and they kept me on the phone about an hour asking me questions.  They asked me not to call the newspapers or the radio media.  We didn't call anyone else nor did we tell anyone else.   The very next day, we looked in the newspaper to see if there was any article of what we saw the evening before and there was none.   We we eventually moved away to upstate N.Y.  This was in 1963.  After living there awhile, one evening we watched T.V. and saw a program which showed a couple who claimed to be abducted on board a UFO, and they had been hypnotised and they described the object.   We could hardly believe our eyes when we saw the same object we had seen that evening in the Bronx.  We then knew we had seen something that was from outer space, a UFO.   From then on, I know in my heart that there are space vehicles of other planets.  I no longer feel those who  report UFO sightings that they are imagining or not being truthful.   Thank God my husband had been home that evening and saw what I did, for it he wasn't there, he wouldn't have believed me.   This is the truth, and even though it was a very long time ago, it is something I will never forget.   One more thing, when the object took off, it went into the direction of Orchard Beach.

       "       \"Triangular shaped object I was driving west on State highway 4 between Rosburg and Naselle at about 20:00.  I hadn’t even gotten a half mile from my house when I saw a triangular shaped craft floating slowly above tree line next to me, to the north.  It was moving in a south easterly direction.  The only thing in the are it was coming from is forest.  The direction it was going is forest and rivers.  I don’t remember what prompted me to look in that direction but, when I saw it I pulled my vehicle over and got out.   My girlfriend was following me in her car and I attempted to flag her down so she could see it too but, she just waved at me.  I stood on the side of the road and observed the craft for about 3-4 minutes until it was out of my sight.  There was no sound being emitted from the craft.  I was racking my brain trying to figure out what it was; it wasn’t a modern aircraft that I knew of because there is nothing I know of that can move that slow and stay in flight except helicopt! ers, but they create a lot of rotor wash and noise.  The craft had 3 lights on it, that I could see. I could only make out the shape, not the color as it was dark so all I could make out was a silhouette from the moon light.  I can only speculate on the size, I guess it was about 100m in length. When I got where I was going I told my girlfriend what I saw and asked her if she had seen it.  She hadn’t and she thought I was just waving at her.  Her mother and friend asked me if I had any missing time. I guess that’s a sign of abduction, who knows.  There wasn’t any missing time. Once it was gone from my sight I got in my truck and drove off. I was in highschool at the time, now in the military.  I am totally guessing on the year.  It had to be between 1997 and 1998.  I'm pretty sure it was in the fall. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the event is approximate.  PD))\",\n",

I will try to research and contact the trucking company I used to work for, to get the exact time that I was there. I do however remember intimate details of the craft that I saw. At about 4 am on this night, it was a clouded sky, as I pulled into the pilot travel center off of 10th street, next to the comfort inn. I began to park near the end of the lot on its north side. Something told me to look up and I did.  Above the cab of my truck about 50 to 75 feet up was a large saucer shaped craft.  I know it was not a hallucination, because it passed over a street lamp and the glow of the light illuminated a sort of upside down bowl depression on the bottom of the craft. I estimated its speed at around 5 - 10 mph moving in a northly direction. the craft was at least 100' in diameter. with a row of small lights around the central bowl depression which had a lip on the bottom o! f the craft, on the outside of the lip of the bowl were about 10 or so lights spaced evenly.  There was no sound at all. I am terrible at drawing but I will try to get someone to work up a sketch of the craft. Do you know of anyone who saw anything similar around the time i did in the same place?  I will try to get back to you with more informaiton and a sketch.

       "       'A phone call from a purported alien living on earth willing to share his views re: himself and our civilization This report is not concerning the sighting of a ufo type craft, but re: a phone call from a man purporting to be an alien being.  My wife and I were told about him by a female friend living in Chicago, who had become his acquaintance. The call lasted approximately one hour, during which time he explained his origin, how he came to this planet, his people\\'s purpose in being here, and how he currently occupied the body of a man born on earth. During the conversation he also answered a number of my questions: about his view of our civilization, the amount of time he and those of his particular race had been on earth, the number of his people living among our population, and certain questions re: history and current events. The gentleman was astonishingly clear and logical in his expression; almost like a scientist or professor.  He also seemed almost Spock-like in his lack of emotion. Should you wish to have a more thorough report I can send in more detail the topics of our conversation.  It has been about thirteen years, but I believe I can recall a number of points he made.   Thank You  Sincerely ((name deleted)) ((NUFORC Note:  We have met with the source of the report, and we deem him to be a serious-minded source.    PD)) ((ADDENDUM FROM SAME INDIVIDUAL WHO SUBMITTED REPORT)) Peter, I am going to break the rules as far as filing this more detailed report of my conversation with the gentleman from Chicago.  I apologize in advance, because I know you are highly disciplined in your work...It is just that I\\'d like to get this to you via your personal e-mail (In truth, I\\'m a real amateur on the workings of the internet.) As you will read, I will include the names of both the extraterrestial being, as well as the man whose body he purported to occupy (who is now, as of about a decade ago, deceased.)  I will leave it to your discretion as to whether you wish to include  that purportedly occupied person\\'s name. Tacco and I sat down together to put in place the clear memories of what was shared.  We know that we\\'ve lost certain things that were said - to our great regret - but what is written to you is quite accurate according to the gentleman\\'s statements and claims. ---------------------------------- Recollections of A Call from an Extraterrestial Who Gave Us the Name \"Shimikus Etua\" In the summer of 1997 I received a call from a Philippine born woman in Chicago - a long time friend who once babysat for our children - with regard to an older man she had met.  The gentleman, she told us, identified himself initially as a \"Eugene Randall\" and lived in the Chicago suburbs.  She, being of an extraordinary open and pure nature, invited him to her family\\'s residence to take more time to visit.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Randall visited our friend and her family quite regularly after the initial meeting. It was in the course of these visits that Mr. Randall told our friend that he, indeed, wasn\\'t of this world, and identified himself  as, I believe it is called, a \"walk-in,\" by the name of Shimikus Etua. After a number of these visits by the gentleman, our friend called us to share the matter.  At the end of our phone call, I asked her if this person would mind calling me directly.  She said she thought it possible, and that he seemed quite open to share with those who could be open to him, and said she\\'d ask him.  Several nights later, we received a call from Shimikus Etua. The following is a listing of recollections, and personal impressions I had from the phone call: 1.) My first impression was that I was talking to a very serious and almost professorial individual who didn\\'t express much emotion.  He seemed almost Spock-like.  There was no feeling of his being delusional or inconsistant.  He spoke in measured tones and answered my questions without hesitation or wasted words. 2.) Shimikus (from now on \\'S\\'),  said that he came from a planetary system somewhere in the vicinity of what we call the North Star.  He said that he\\'d traveled to our planet on one of a few very large \"mother ships.\"  I believe he mentioned that he\\'d actually been born enroute to our solar system. 3.) It was hard for me to believe, but he gave his age as \"about 3000 years old.\" 4.) When I asked about his civilization\\'s belief in a supreme being he immediately answered in the affirmative.  He then went on to explain that there was a time when his people were not good (I believe he even used the word \"evil), and that they tended to be self destructive as well as destructive to other civilizations.  However, long ago, before the journey to earth, a \"priest\" among his people began to teach a path of goodness, that, somehow had a great impact for the good.  His people went through a tremendous change, and left behind their negativity. 5.) S mentioned that his people are more than a little concerned with the elements of self destruction on our planet, and wish to help us evolve as a species as they did long ago (I took this to mean, in the sense of \\'consciousness\\' and spirituality.)  When I asked how his people look at us, he hesitated for a moment, and then said that it is how we may look at \"primitive tribes\" in our own world. 6.) He explained that those among his race who are now on the earth have come here with the help of earth people who are aware of them, and who have voluntarily offered their bodies and personae as vehicles for these aliens.  S spoke in glowing terms of Eugene Randall, who had offered himself for S.  (note: I could see that this whole matter of earth people contributing their bodies was entirely of their own free volition, and not anything like a hostile take over, ie, the 1950\\'s horror classic, \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers.\")  S also mentioned a Russian man, who, years ago during the Soviet period, had done what Eugene had done; the same admiration and gratitude was expressed for his courage and sacrifice.  (I don\\'t remember the details of the Russian man\\'s story.) 7.) I asked how many of S\\'s people were on the earth in the capacity mentioned above.  He estimated it to be about 8,000. Living in Seattle, I asked if he knew how many may be in the Puget Sound area.  He said he didn\\'t know, and that they are not all in good contact with one another (I got the feeling that this race of people has been among us for a very long time, according to his conversation.)   He did mention that there was a way for me to find someone if I wished; he explained that there is a symbol that his race uses, and went on to explain it:  It is two squares, one over the other, something similar to the Jewish star of David.  Only the squares are juxtaposed: One drawn straight up and down, and the other rotated so that the corners of the second square extend out past the middle of each of the first star\\'s mid-lines - so you end up with an eight-pointed star shape. S told me that if I put this symbol in my car window, I may be approached and asked about where I learned the symbol...\"that may be one of our people\" he told me. 8.) S expressed the serious concern of his race for our use of nuclear power, and said that even the \"peaceful use\" of nuclear reactors is very harmful to the cosmos.  Nuclear war was just a horror, as he expressed it, not just for us but for the others in our cosmos.  He said we didn\\'t begin to understand the problems nuclear energy creates.  He also mentioned a concern for mid eastern wars, and the use of chemical weapons.  Though I didn\\'t learn just how, S said that his people have ways to counteract the weapons we build; he mentioned their spoiling of chemical weapon stockpiles in Iran. 9.) (I had some trouble getting this) The flood of Noah was mentioned:  S explained that one of their larger spacecraft had lost its bearings and crashed in the arctic regions, causing a tremendous and sudden meltdown of ice, and subsequent flooding of portions of the globe (I assumed a tremendous explosion and release of energy.)  This, he said, was a contributing factor to the flood. 10.) Situations of co-habitation with earth people: It was also mentioned to me that there was a history of sexual co-habitation between members of S\\'s race and earth people.  In particular, he mentioned that there were cases of this in the Philippine Islands (modern name), and that quite a few hybrid children were born as a result.  Lineages continue to this day.  An interesting note is that S mentioned our former babysitter who he had first met, and who had called us about him, was of that hybrid lineage. 11.) I asked if there are any other extraterrestial civilizations near earth at this time.  He said that there are, and that, unlike his own people, they don\\'t all have their personal problems worked out.  While his own civilization has only the desire to help us develop in a positive direction, there are others who would use us for cruel experimentation - almost like animal labs, and even  practice self gratifying sexual abuse with our people (certain horrible abduction experiences? - my reflection).  S mentioned that his people try to drive off these evil races when possible. 12.) A humorous incident:  S has a brother, he told me, named Andronicus.  He said that one day, in downtown Chicago, they were in an elevator in a high rise building, and somehow, were in their original forms...A businessman suddenly entered the elevator, looked at them in shock, and blurted out, \"Where did you come from?!\" Andronicus, who was just as shaken up, reacted with, \"Well, from my mother!\" (S did mention that if I saw him in his original form, that I may be startled, though I got the sense that it is not that far from our own earthly bodies.) 13.) S visited our friend, the Philippine woman, many times in the form of Eugene Randall.  She told me in a call sometime after my call with him, that he came to her home one afternoon to help celebrate her birthday.  After a while he expressed weariness and asked if he could take a rest.  She put him on the bed that she and her husband slept in.  Soon, a group of her church friends came by to say happy birthday, and saw this \\'unknown man\\' on her bed.  They became outraged and spread gossip about her.  When she later told S about what had happened, he became sad and upset at the same time.  He told our friend, and I paraphrase here, \"How long have our people been here on this planet working to help you, and still you don\\'t understand the meaning of friendship and trust!\" *Several years ago, our friend called and told us that Eugene Randall had been found dead in his apartment by a neighbor.  What of Shimikus?  I have no idea, nor does she.',\n",
       "       'Shinny golden matalic disk/sauser shaped object seen for 2-3 secs....then disappeared!   Today\\'s incident:  I was outside in the backyard getting some sunshine, and as I was looking up towards the south-west, at about 1 or 2 o\\'clock, I saw a shiny matalic object, moving rapidly (I say 200-500 mph) in the sky towards the south-east at about 2,000 to 5,000 ft. It had a bright golden/matalic glow to it. I saw it for only 2 or 3 seconds and then....it disappeared. There were clouds in the sky, but where I saw the UFO flying, it was perfectly clear and deep blue...It didn\\'t go inside/behind a cloud,like alot of reports suggest...it just vanished..into thin air!!!  I\\'m almost 51, and have had numerous siteings in the span of my lifetime. Incident # 2 : I also want to mention an incident that occured last winter(nov. or dec.) I was laying in bed.It was early morning,and I had just woke up.I suddenly became aware of some type of communication (could have been telepathic) coming from somewhere.The communication asked me, \" Do you want to come watch us leave\"...It startled me BIG TIME..because it was in my thought pattern. I believe I could have been abducted earlier that morning or night. The only way I can describe it was that it sounded like an insect talking.. If that makes any sense..like a praying mattis..or something like that. VERY strange!  If anyone else out there has had a similar experience, I would like to hear/ read about it.  I\\'m 100% sane, with an IQ in the 130 + range..so I\\'m NOT some loony-tune. Anyways..oh yeah..I like to hear from an expert on ufo abductions, if possible.I believe I\\'ve been abducted in the past also. Thanks. God bless.',\n",
       "       'In 1953, at the age of 3 years old  I was Contacted by what is described as a \"GREY\".  This happened in Ky in 1953.  Now, as to why I was there since I am from Indiana,  My mother and Father and I was living out of a car since my dad did not have a job and we lived basically out of a car.  We were somewhat like gypsy\\'s and mom and dad would get work with Carnivals.  Tv was almost NONE EXISTENT since we had no home most of the time.  Now, I mentioned this because I was NOT influenced by any tv program that might have made me \"DREAM\" what happened to me.  I am entirely SERIOUS about what happened to me!!!  Make no mistake about it.It has perplexed me for years, and only recently I found out that there are places like this to report things of this nature.  I think this might intriuge you as what was said to me by my Mother only about three years ago, SHE TOLD ME that at the age of nine or ten she was ABDUCTED and taken up into a ship that had NO CORNER\\'S in it!  This is important since mom had NO WAY of knowing that reports given by OTHER abductee\\'s reported the SAME THING! I almost fell out of my chair when she related her experience to me. I NEVER knew about it till three years ago!!!!!  I was telling her of my experience, and that is when it came into the conversation about mom.  Now, my EXPERIENCE as I call it. My Grandmother and Grandfather had to come to Ky to retreive me since my mom anmd dad were about to go away to prison for an extended period of time.  They brought a travel trailer with them for us to stay in till the end of mom and dad\\'s trial.  This, is where the CONTACT came to me. Grandma had made a palete on the floor beside there bed in the back of the trailer.  I was sleeping and awoke abruptly and had the distinct feeling before opening my eyes something was LOOKING at me, and, IT WAS! Standing over me was an odd looking creature THIN in nature with an oval looking head with large dark eyes.When it saw that I was aware of it b! eing there, it raised up straight, turned to the right and in ! a Jerky strobe light looking way, turned to the hallway, and about half the way down the hall simply VANISHED into what I call \"THIN AIR\", or disapeared or whatever you want to call it. I remember this event as if it was yesterday, and can remember every aspect of it. I have had other instances in my life and in one instanse even had a wittness to it that scared the crap out of him so much so he ran into the house because tyhings outside during this event was \"NOT RIGHT\". That would be another story another time. I am a Nam Vet and also had experiences with that too. As if I was being informed of danger ahead of time. I was a Pointman with the 173rd Airborne Brigade. This is important to me to know there are other\\'s out here that KNOW of there existence, and KNOW what I have gone through all these years. This is NO JOKE! And, I do not take lightly, ANYONE taking what I relate to them LIGHTLY either! I want answers and I will do whatever it take s to find out the \"WHY\".   I thank you for your time.

       "       'Please read these abductions going on with a 41yo male. **PLEASE DON\\'T USE MY REAL NAME**  I will tell you my story. Well, here it goes, I am a 41 yo who had a heart transplant in 2001 and a stroke which left my right side partially limited.  I was living in San Jose and had a fantastic position with an international hi-tech firm doing project management in Palo Alto.  It was a great future in store for me, and I was very excited to be a part of it.  I am living north now in McKinleyville, CA. From what I can remember in the past:  5 years old:  I was climbing on the outer railing when I fell off the second floor and right before I landed on my back on the tiles, I felt my body being set down very slowly.  Being five I thought that was really neat and ran into the kitchen to tell my Grandmother who got angry and scolded me telling my \"You\\'re full of \"cazzata\" which translates to \"Bull S****\" and scolded me to my room. I never forgot that moment even for a second. At the age of 24: I was away at collage and living in an old c.1894 house with four other students.  For about two months at least 2 mornings per week I had a series of waking up and being completely unable to move anything except for my eyes for approx 30 minutes.  Another thing was the \"weight\" that heavily pressed my body into the mattress, it felt like someone was on top of me. That was a disturbing times but it ceased at two months.  Not ever was I into \\'ghosts\\' but that made me serious about wondering if they really exist.  I searched the old house at Humboldt State University\\'s library and found that the 1894 house was built right over the ashes of a previous building.  The wondering about a ghost faded as I was in an intensive program that needed my focus. 2 years ago: I woke up in my bed and looked at my watch seeing that three days had passed with no recollection of anything. I was extremely upset about it and went to my Doctor who took a blood test and everything was normal.  I did not tell him about why I was so frazzled.  In addition I had multiple dreams where I was unable to move except for turning my head.  It was a very strange room with two other tables with people laying on them and again there was a being 8-9 feet tall wearing an outfit with a hood and shielding for the face working on the body to my right.  I can recall turning my head to the left where small rectangle windows looking down at Clam Beach from I guess around 7000 feet, just a guess.  During the two years I had multiple dreams like that. The last week:  The last night for the third time in the past week I dreamt of being in an underground \\'lab?\\' or some kind of very large underground facility \\'people\\' of two types.  One type was 8-9 feet tall and the other was \\'human-like\\' who can communicate using their minds.  (I feel like I\\'m going crazy.)  They were very calm and \\'loving.\\'  There are dozens of windows in the rock where the \\'humans\\' would live, they would open into the rock.  I would wake up and fall right back into the same dream.  I have noticed new skin-marks and two new tiny scars. I live alone, my family is in So. California. That\\'s my story and you may do what you like with it, but again, PLEASE DO NOT USE MY NAME. Thank you ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))',\n",
       "       'A small light in the distance changes direction and appears to come closer. For what it\\'s worth.  This happened in 1954.  I was 17 years old.  I was with 2 friends, coming home from somewhere.  One girl lived across the street from me, the other was coming home with me to spend the night.  The night was pleasant, and we dilly dallied as we walked.  Was the time of year it was dark between 8 pm and 9 pm.  We were stopped, they were talking, while i looked up into the sky, and my sight was drawn to a light which, if still, would have looked no different than a star, but it was moving.  So i thought it curious, and watched.  It was moving left to right, or north to south, seemingly very fast, tho i couldn\\'t gauge the distance.  It did seem extremely far out there, not a nearby airplane.  And there was no sound.  For it to be any further away than a local small airplane, meant it was going extremely fast.  I said to my friends, \"I think i see a flying saucer.\"  In those days that\\'s what we called them, not knowing the term \"ufo\".  They ! told me it was an airplane. I said it was going too fast to be an airplane.  They said it was a meteor then.  I said it wasn\\'t going that fast.  They told me i was not seeing a flying saucer because they do not exist.  I looked away for a while, then looked back up to the area in which i\\'d seen the light.  It was there, but it had changed directions, and was larger and brighter than an ordinary star.  It was moving more slowly, and instead of moving north to south it was coming westward, at a slower pace.  I said to my friends, \"I think it\\'s coming towards us.\"  They both screamed and ran towards home. I really wanted to watch to see what the light was going to do, but the told me to \"come\" and \"hurry\". So the girl that was staying overnight and i ran to my house. But that was not all that happened that night.  I don\\'t know if you want to hear this part.  It involves, not a ufo but what must have been an abduction.  Me.  I questioned my friend the next morning.  Too afraid to mention it to my mother.  \"Did i miss out on some activity, or goings on during the night? too tired to wake up?\"  I asked her.  She said  \"not that i know of, I slept well and didn\\'t hear anything.\"  She was not in my room, but in a spare room during the night.  The things i was remembering involved activity, moving around, and - flying in and out the window.  I didn\\'t want to mention the part about flying to anyone, not even my friend. This is all i can recall of this event.  I\\'m 75 now and have had other experiences but this event is the only one in which i may have actually seen a ufo.  I could tell about an alien encounter, but not at this time.',\n",
       "       'Childhood vision of a gray. For what it’s worth this is one of my first real vivid memories.  I was approximately 3 ½ years old.  The year was 1964 and lived in an unusual shaped (barn style) two story house on the edge of town but still populated area.   My parents were upstairs in bedroom, I was downstairs and glanced towards a window on the side of the house and observed the head and shoulders of a gray looking in.  Didn’t know what a gray was supposed to look like until much later.  Not saying abduction at all.   Vividly recall staring from about five or six feet away at the creature and a powerful almost telepathic memory of me over and over silently projecting, \"What are you?”\"    Don’t recall any received reply or acknowledgment, just a large almond, dark eyed stare from a short, small, thin necked creature. My minds memory recalls depth to the image, unlike cardboard cutout or a mask.  After about a minute or a little less, I fled up the stairs and tried to tell my parents I had seen \"something\" outside the window.  I received the \"it’s alright\" talk and hugs and have had that memory all my life.',\n",

We were having casual conversation when all of a sudden a bright flash of light (As if someone had taken a picture of us from the hood of the vehicle the flash being multiplied several times) completely blinded us for 1-2.5 seconds, a long enough period where we had both noticed it.  Right after I was able to see again I looked towards where the light came from only to see a small light (White in color) in the sky flying North at a very high rate of speed.

       "       'Visited on military base as a teenager  500 Lights On Object0: Yes I was 12 or 13 at the time. My father was an U.S. Air Force officer stationed at Hickam AB in Hawaii. In my bed in our military base housing.  My room was off the kitchen and on the first floor. All other bedrooms were on second floor. One night, my room filled with a greenish/blue light. I remember feeling paralyzed.  Awake but unable to move. Could barely life my head and I saw a smallish creature, greenish or grey in color, standing at the foot of my bed.  It was definitely humanoid, two legs, two thin long arms, a large head with huge round dark eyes. It didn\\'t talk but communicated with me some other way. It told me to not be afraid. It just studied me.  At one point it communiciated something like \"You don\\'t believe I\\'m real?\" \"Here,\" it continued, \"touch me.\"  My inability to move was relaxed in on arm as it moved closer to me.  I lifted my hand and tried to touch it. My finger seemed to go right through it\\'s wrist or hand.  There was a membrane but gelatin-like flesh inside of it. There was something else, I recall that there were holes of some sort in its palms. That\\'s all I remember.  That paralysis occured on occasion during my teen years but no more visitations. Was I abducted?  My father incidently was -according to family stories - involved in Blue Book. We lived at McChord AFB from 1962-1969.

       "       'UFO above my house. Possibly abducted. Sometime in the middle of October 2010, I was up late playing computer games in my bedroom on the second story of my home here in Harleysville Pennsylvania. I was getting tired around 12:30am and decided to go to sleep around 1:00am. I fell asleep quite quickly in nothing but my boxers.  Before I go into detail about the encounter I experienced, allow me to explain the layout of my room relative to the map I submitted. My bedroom is on the second story on the southwest end of my home. I have 3 windows in my room on the front face of the house and have access to both the attic and the only fire escape on the building. This house used to be an old office building in which my bedroom was one of the offices used. My actual bed is located in the southwest corner next to a window and directly next to the fire escape door. This door has no handle on the outside and only a bar-release on the inside similar to what you would find on the inside of a school entrance door or office building. The door also has a 1.3x1.3 foot window in the top center. The actual fire escape on the outside of the door is nothing more than a metal platform and railing leading down the side of my house with metal stairs. I often use this to have a cigarette when I am at home since smoking inside the house is forbidden by the landlord. This goes to say I am quite familiar with what the scenery on the outside of my home ! looks like in this location. I awoke on this day around 3am based on the dark of night outside, however, when I awoke I was already outside on my fire escape platform. I had not been dreaming as far as I could tell since everything was as it was when I am awake, and have had many vivid almost lucid dreams in the past, and I can tell you this was not that sensation. I was very groggy and confused as to how I had walked in my sleep. I have not sleepwalked since I was about 8 years old, and at this time I was 19 almost 20. I almost immediately noticed something very very large above me after this initial confusion, and took quick notice to my door being closed behind me leaving no way of re-entering my home. As soon as I noticed this however, I felt the urge to look at this large object hovering above me. As I looked up I noticed it was sort of rounded in shape but had many many lights on the underside of it. It was directly above me so I had no view of the sides of the object.  The lights were a very very bright white.  Nothing like any fluorescent bulb I have ever seen. These lights were flashing without any pattern it seemed and were located all over the underside of the object in rectangular and very long trapezoidal shapes.  The object had to have been at least 250 feet in diameter, possibly larger. The underside of the object also had many things jutting out from it with these lights on it as well, but I took a firm notice to one in particular.  There was this large piece with the lights on the side of it coming out from the right of the object. It\\'s shape was like an upside down cone with the end cut off. It resembled an air filter for a high performance engine in a car.  It had symmetrical lights all around its sides that were identical to the ones on the underside of the object, however the bottom of this piece jutting out was a very very dark gray-black color. When I had first looked up, the lights were so blinding that I had to shield my eyes with one hand to see they were flashing and their shapes and locations. I observed all of this within less than 90 seconds before I became very disoriented. I forgot what I was doing, where I was at, and who I was. Almost as if these lights were inducing an acute case of amnesia. The last thing I can remember before passing out was the strange sensation of floating. I had never experienced this before, but it was as if I were suddenly weightless. My feet were no longer touching the cold metal platform and I was no longer shielding my eyes. As soon as I was blinded by the lights that were flashing I seemed to lose consciousness, unless the lights caused me to forget everything leaving me no memory of anything afterwards. Throughout these short minutes the object made absolutely no sound. It was as if it was making everything around it completely quiet. If you have ever heard the saying \"Silence is Deafening,\" I would have to agree, there were no sounds made after I noticed the object above me. This was extremely strange since my home is on a main road, and relatively close to the Pennsylvania Turnpike. Hearing not even the sound of a cricket chirp or the hum of the highway was definitely weird. I also remember the silence being almost suffocating. It felt very heavy, as if it were making the air thick like soup. In my short, and very close observation, I remember the object being about 20 to 40 feet above me and the space in between my house and the neighbors house, and the tree in between the front of our homes was blocking out a portion of this large object. There was no wind, as if Time had stopped in its tracks. This is all simply speculation, but it was what it seemed to me. After I lost consciousness, it got extremely bizarre. I remember waking up without any senses except for my sight and sense of balance. I was laying down with my eyes looking upwards towards what seemed to be a ceiling. My eyes were not working correctly though. It was as if I had been administered eye drops that you would get at the doctors to dilate your pupils. Everything was very blurry and distorted. I remember very little, but I do remember everything was a green/brown/gray color around me. I also remember seeing strange objects above me that appeared to be tools or examination equipment above me, none of which seemed to be created by humans. It was very very blurry though so it was hard to tell if that was exactly what it was. I then remember a figure move into view above me. I was unable to move at all, and my vision was very poor so I could discern nothing about this being other than it seemed a little taller than I am and it had appendages like a human being (arms, torso, head, legs, etc.). It did not speak to me, however, I seemed to hear a voice in my head. It was much less a voice than it was a feeling or emotion being conveyed. The very last thing I can remember was feeling very calm, as if this being was trying to help me in some sort of way. The \"trying to help you\" feeling I received was much less about me in particular, but more of a \"you\" as in \"your race.\" I then saw one of the objects above me move slightly, and I lost consciousness again. When I came to I was sitting on the edge of my bed. My bed was made very neatly as if I had never layed down at all that night. When i looked at my alarm clock, the time was about 4:45am. I tried to remember how I got there, but nothing came to mind. I tried to sleep, but my thoughts were buzzing faster than I could even keep up with. I could not sleep no matter how hard I tried that night. The only thing I kept asking myself was \"Why wasn\\'t I scared or afraid throughout this entire experience?\"   I am not trying to garner attention in any way shape or form with this.. This is why I am choosing to remain anonymous. I just hope that maybe this can help somebody understand things a little better, even if I can not understand any of this myself. I always thought the UFO phenomenon was a bunch of crap before this experience. Since this experience I have been haunted, and have wanted to tell somebody but have always been too afraid of being called a crackpot. The only person I have ever told this story to is my best friend, and he is probably the only person who will ever know who I am and what I witnessed. I have witnessed a few other strange occurrences that happened after this account I have just given you, but they are far less important I think..  I hope this will help in some way shape or form.

       "       'Possible abduction, witnessed several hovering discs from the ground   The night this happened, my husband and I were up pretty late watching a movie. It ended about 1:30 AM, and I went up to bed. My husband was crashed out in the basement, so I decided to leave him there. I climbed into my bed next to my daughter (who frequently sneaks out of her bed to sleep with me). I must have been exhausted and just crashed, which is odd for me, because it usually takes several minutes to get to sleep, even when it\\'s late. The next morning, I woke up extremely dehydrated and recalled a very startling and vivid “dream” of being around aliens and UFOs. This was so startling, and unlike any other dream that I’ve ever had, so I decided to explore other options, such as an actual abduction. I’ve heard of the UFO/alien phenomena, but had never given it much consideration till this event. I don\\'t recall being \"beamed up\" but I clearly remember being taken somehow to a place with a lot of hallways. Then I remember feeling like I was being instructed to urinate in a long and wide tube with strange markings on the side. I think the markings indicated measurements or something. The last thing I remember was being on the ground, outside, in what looked like a vacant/abandoned parking lot. I remember the concrete had lots of cracks in it like it was old and worn. There were evergreen trees surrounding this place. There were other people standing around me with cages of small animals, like house cats, birds, dogs, etc. I got the feeling like these people around me were going to release them. I remember feeling like it was approaching morning, but it was still dark outside. I looked up in the sky and noticed several (at least four) UFO craft very near above the ground of this parking lot, just hovering. There were three red lights coming from the bottom of them that ! blurred or blinked till they became one light beam. It\\'s very hard to explain. These craft were larger than I’d have expected for what you see on television. I guess I’d always pictured them being the size of a small bus, but these were the size of a large home. I don’t remember ever being inside of the craft, but being inside of a building or structure near this lot. The other people there, like me, weren\\'t completely in reality. It was like we were in a trance. I remember standing in this lot, looking up, and seeing one UFO fly high, stop, fly a little bit to the left, stop, fly higher, stop, and then flew off and vanished. So, after looking up at these UFOs from the ground, I remember it all of a sudden clicking (like a switch had been turned on) that this wasn\\'t normal... And I remember taking off running as fast as I could. I had just snapped back to reality. As soon as I started to run, I recall the others, which I assumed had also been taken, almost clicking too and ! scattering in all directions. The last thing I recall is some ! kind of luminescent \"beam\" of sorts encasing me as I ran. I woke up very dehydrated, a bit weak, and still tired, but I remembered this almost like it had really happened. After that night, I had a minor sore throat and occasional minor pains in my abdomen. This lasted about two weeks, off and on. Ordinarily, I would have chalked this up to just being a dream or my subconscious manifesting my fears in an odd way, but the next day, my daughter said something extremely startling to me...\"Mommy, who were those boys that came and took you when you were sleeping?\" I questioned her a little, but I didn\\'t want to push it with her, so I sort of left it be. She didn\\'t seem particularly worried or concerned about it, just curious. (She was just shy of 4 years old at the time.) I’ve since asked her about it off and on, and she doesn’t appear to recall much more than she already said. Since then, I’ve started to attend MUFON meetings and I joined a group for experiencers and have been speaking with the leader, who is also a regression therapist. I haven’t shared this with anybody outside of this small group about this experience. I’m pretty sure my peers, family, and friends would think I’m crazy, so I would like to keep this somewhat anonymous. Upon reflection of this event, I started to piece together a few of my memories from childhood, and start questioning them more. For example, I remember a period of missing time when I was about 12 years old, where there were several hours unaccounted for. I had never even thought to question the “missing time” or even heard that phrase till after this last event occurred. If any of this seems relevant, please feel free to contact me, but I would appreciate my name being withheld from any public report.',\n",
       "       'I didn\\'t believe in UFO abduction until it happened to me. I woke up six months after I had participated in finding a downed plane in the Angela, Montana area.  What was unusual about that event is that I established a grid pattern outside of the FAA grid pattern and the people who came with me to search in the Angela area found the plane only hours after we started that day.  The FAA led search had been fruitless until that seventh day when people were finally willing to listen to me.  I am a sensitive and was led to the area the plane was found by the dead pilot. Six months later, I am floating in the air with this white R2D2 type unit shining in my bedroom under some sort of white beam of light.  I realize I am paralyzed.  These probe type things snake out and attach to my head.  I cannot speak.  My husband is dead asleep.  I can only scream telepathically, \"In Jesus name, you will let me go! I command you to let me go ...\"  Hey, it had worked on what I perceived to be ghouls before. The white unit said, \"Sleep.  You will sleep...\" in this hypnotic voice.  I told him to go to hell.  I was wide awake and we went back and forth while I commanded the thing in the name of the Eloihim and all angels to let me go.  I seemed to be floating above my bed almost to the ceiling with seven things that were making this weird   hum noise attached to my head. This goes on for some time and the mechanical voice keeps saying, \"Sleep ...\"  Suddenly, a new voice starts to speak to the angry and freaked out me who is eloquently telepathically telling this robot thing off, and it is a non-robotic, female voice.  She calms me down.  I ask her why they are doing this to me.  She says, \"We have heard about what you did in Jordan (the town larger than Angela) and we have come to see why you can operate on such a high frequency with your mind.\"  I get very calm.  I end up losing time.  I don\\'t know anything for a time with this humming noise taking over in my brain.  She informs me they are done.  I ask her what they found.  She replies, \"You are ... a secret weapon.\"  I am a pacifist and am very disappointed by this conclusion. I find myself tucked back into my bed and my husband still won\\'t wake up.  I am freaking, but I go back to sleep, still feeling paralyzed.  I wake up, record the \\'dream\\'.  What is so strange about this is I don\\'t believe in UFOs at all at this time.  I have a first cousin who claims she was abducted on Lolo Pass and I have always thought her a nut.  I talk to my husband only about this for years because I am confused to the core over \\'the dream\\'. As a sensitive, I talk to dead people.  Unfortunately, the ETs are making my life too complicated.  They put things into my dreams and I don\\'t like it.  I feel like I\\'m in some Star Trek episode some nights.  There are definitely a variety of them.  They seem to be extra dimensional.  I prefer a world view that includes my dead mother talking to me or a dead actor telling me he was murdered over these others who are coming through star gates or portals,  Even the little demon type beings are easier for me.  I\\'m scared of being abducted again.  I\\'m not afraid of no ghosts.',\n",
       "       '4 amber lights in formation moved slowly over me silently , seemed like either 2 objects or 1 big one. Driving N bound Hwy 99 just past Queens ave I noticed to the right 4 new radio towers with amber glowing lights.  They seemed to be very high radio towers and were stationary.  But towers in the area have red or white lights.  The lights then began to move slowly and together up a little then to the left.  2 amber lights (all 4 amber lights seemed to have a downward flare to them)in front about 100 feet apart and angled like this symbol \\\\ were separated by about 350-400 feet from the trailing 2 amber lights which were angled more like this symbol / in a trapezoidal formation with the upper right light back some and the lower right light seeming closer assuming all the lights were equal in size, I would estimate each light to be about 1-2 feet in diameter and emitting a soft glow. I could not see anything between them and afterwards I realized there might not have been any stars between them either on a clear calm night with plenty of stars out.  I rolled the! window down and heard nothing other than road and wind noise since I was traveling about 60mph as it passed directly over head.  I thought it could be helicopters in formation until the lights moved so uniformly in paired formation that it seemed like it was either 2 objects (one on the left and one on the right) or one very large object.  The trailing 2 lights had about 150-200 feet between them. The trailing 2 lights adjusted a bit and the upper more to the rear light came forward about even top to bottom relative to me, with the bottom light seemingly not to change position at all while the first 2 lights on the left did not change relative position either as they moved across the horizon.  The 4 lights moved in equal rates of speed from the right of the highway over it to the left and continued in a westerly direction, one of the lights faded out, I believe the upper right and then glowed back on in a different position.  Then 2 went out and 1 came back on leaving 3 li! ghts then the 4th returned as it gained speed moderately.  It ! seemed l ike one large dark object with the tail portion rotating about 30 degrees around the lower axis.  As I continued down the road I lost sight of it and after 3 minutes I pulled over to see if it was still around but only saw 1 amber colored light flicker in amongst the stars and down low there were security lights and buildings obstructing lower level of view.  When I realized it was not helicopters I felt plenty eerie, and was greatly relieved when it continued onward.  I wonder why it was so low to the ground and stationary in a populated area and felt sorry for whoever was in that area at the time, it could have been an abduction or a return, or… ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

       "       \"sighting,experiences, dreams, my story   Hi my name is ((deleted)) I’m reporting this because I have yet to do an official submission of my case, although I have told Linda Howe my story once before.  My entire life seems to have some connection with ufo’s and although I never realized until my twenties I've always had some sort of connection with the topic. As a child I frequently had dreams of craft mostly black triangles and rectangles with red light at corners, keep in mind these dreams occurred before I knew anything about ufology and only found out later on that these types of craft were really being seen by people. I disregarded these dreams for a long time.  In 1997 my mom and sister had a night time sighting of a dark black sphere with lights moving across its rim over Camp Pendleton marine Base near our house, it wasn’t till then that I began to start taking ufos seriously. Then in 2009 I went to drive to the beach to pick up my friend to go skateboarding that I had a sighting of my own.  I drove to an intersection near the 76 expressway in Oceanside and at the red light I happened to look up.  In the sky I saw a ball of bluish white light doing zig zag’s and then stopping then starting to zig zag again, the entire sighting lasted only about 7 seconds. Eventually the ball of light dropped down behind a mountain and out of view The sky wasn’t fully dark but was getting dark this happened around 6-7 pm.  This sighting further increased my interest and caused me to become an amateur ufologist in my own rite. A few years later in 2009 I became alarmed after some more intriguing experiences that took place in my room.  One night I was awoken at 3:00 am by a loud sparking sound and I looked up and saw a small orb of light shoot trough the corner of my room’s wall.  I’m not saying this object was a UFO but I don’t know what it was, orb, sphere, was it a ghost I have no clue all I know is it probably wasn’t ball lightning.  After the orb incident a few months past and I had a dream the completely rocked my world or at least it might have been a dream……  The following is what I recall from this dream / possible abduction…….I wake up in a foreign alien room, the walls are green and spongy I soon realize I’m not alone and that I’m with other humans all dressed in normal casual clothes and no one is talking and I’m not able to talk, I then realize that there are other beings in the room, these beings are brown humanoids with extremely wrinkly skin, they don’t have any noticeable genitals or sexually features, they have small all black eyes same size as ours but the whole eye is black, they range in height from about 5-6 feet tall, they have no hair, 5 digit fingers and toes like us, no nails, the mouth was hard to see because of the wrinkly skin on their faces.  The beings do not talk or use telepathy they motion to sit down on these bench type things that are almost like grown from the floor, the room is cylindrical and besides the weird benches it’s empty of equipment.  The brown alien guys motion us to site down once we all ! do they begin to project images that seem to float in mid air, the room starts to seem like a theater now, on the images they show peaceful images of the earth and earth life, then the next image will be a negative image of earth floods, war, dead bodies.  They seemed interested in how we felt about these images and the contrasting of the images content. After all this was over we were taken out into a hallway and the last recall I have is walking down this hallway and seeing this rather attractive brunette girl then the memory just stops, like I wasn’t supposed to remember anything else. I know this sounds crazy but I’ve never head another dream this intense and these aliens look like nothing I’ve heard described before and they sure weren’t grays or reptilian or any of the things I’ve heard of in movies.  If this was just a dream then it may be a dream of a real event coming trough.  I’ve sometimes gone to bed and woke up on the couch and other weird things including unexplained marks on my skin.  I don’t really want to say I’m an abductee but the more I learn about it the more and more I feel I fit the category.  Through all of this I'm still quite normal considering these events, but I know how hard it is to express these things so in hopes that others might come forward and hopefully if anyone has seen similar brown beings it would be nice to share.\",\n",
       "       'Night Visitations?   My husband and I woke up at 7 am and he looked at me and asked if I was okay.  I told him \"yeah, why?\" and he proceeded to tell me that something happened the night before.  He knew that I have had at least 10-15 horrible nightmares about alien abduction since I was a child (I am 32 now and have been having these dreams since I was 6-7 years old).  He didn\\'t want to tell me, but he told me to make sure I was okay and to go to the bathroom and take a shower and look over myself.  He was really upsetting me, I refused to go and look until he told me what was going on, and finally he told me that he had a \"dream\" that he woke up and something was holding him down and he saw something \"weird\".  I told him it was just a dream and sleep paralysis. My husband is/was more of a skeptic regarding aliens and the conspiracy theories than I ever have been.  And he then said \"no, you don\\'t understand, I don\\'t have sleep issues, and I know what I saw\".  He went on to explai! n that first he heard what sounded like shuffling around the bed.  The lights were off, but due to ambient light from a distant bathroom nightlight, he could see small shadows when he moved his eyes down as far as he could.  He said his first thought was to wake me up, and he couldn\\'t move and he couldn\\'t make any noise to wake me.  He said \"all I could do was move my eyes around, I couldn\\'t talk or move or anything, it was scary as hell\".  He said finally he was able to move his head down a little and when he did he said there was something the size of our son standing right beside the bed kind of \"looking\" at him.  He said when his head moved, this \"something\" jumped back a little, like it was surprised.  He said he then felt like something larger was in the doorway of our bedroom and he heard shuffling again like what ever it was, it was going away from the bed, and he fell asleep.  To let you know, our son was, at that time, had just turned 7 years old and was about 3\\'3! \" - 3\\'5\" tall.  He said that he knew there was more than one o! f these things in the room and, again, it was \"like something bigger was in the doorway\" he said to me.  I do not recall anything that happened that evening whatsoever. But my husband was so intent, he even bought a black light to inspect the carpet around the bed and got on his hands and knees to find anything that would prove it to me.  The strangest part of this was that we switched sides of the bed that evening for the first time in 7 years, because I told him \"I just want to sleep here\".  I had no real reason why and I haven\\'t done that since.  As a side note, my husband is not the only person who has told me this has happened to them while I was in the room with them, sleeping.  My father also explained to me that a few times in 1979, when I was a couple of months old, that \"demons came out\", held him down to where he couldn\\'t speak or move. He blamed it on my mother, now his ex-wife.  He said that once he was divorced from her, the \"demons quit visiting the house.\"  When they were divorced, I moved with my mother.  He told me that he remembered these \"demons\" holding him down a lot from 1979-1983 - 1983 being the year my mother left him.  My mother collaborated this story when I asked her.  I asked her if anything odd ever happened in her sleep when i was a baby / kid.  She said sometimes she would wake up scared and unable to talk but that it was just \"night terrors\". My father told me this because he was trying to convince me that my mother was evil (bad divorce, even still today), and I personally and directly! asked my mom if she ever had anything weird happen to her while she was asleep around me.  Another time in 1994, my best friend was staying the night with me and claimed to be held down in her sleep.  She said she couldn\\'t see me or hear me but I must have \"drugged\" her because the room was bright white, and she couldn\\'t move or talk.  She was extremely upset because of how scared she was, and continually blamed me.  We were not friends after this because she truly believed I drugged her with something.  My ex-fiance also claimed that he was \"so sick\" he couldn\\'t get up in the middle of the night - (we were both fighting a cold at the time). He said \"I couldn\\'t move or talk or nothing and it was like something was holding me down\".  He also said that when he could finally move that he got up to tell me about it, but I was not there in the house.  He said that I must have got up in the middle of the night to party.  But when he woke up the next morning, he said I was back in bed with him.  He even asked me what time I got back in that morning.  I did not leave and we fought about that.  I do have dreams about abduction, they are very vivid and I can recall a lot about my dreams; however, I do not recall these dreams on the nights that I can remember that my husband, friend, and ex-fiance told me they were held down.  The details and information in these dreams are extremely odd to me - such as the texture of skin when they are holding my hand, a difference in feeling light/heavy, and information given to me.  The dreams have been nightmarish in nature because it\\'s generally scary seeing these things, but things that happen in the dream are really not so bad.  Only once was the dream a complete, horrific nightmare and oddly enough, the aliens in that dream were different than the other dreams.  Is there any explanation for this??

       "       \"Non reflecting Cyclinder shaped craft with no light or movement or noise. The ship was not moving like a flying object but appeared overhead and I was just somehow made to look upwards. Do that a lot to view the start anyway and just had a strange like feeling i was suppose to look up. There were no lights of any form i could see and there was no noise. The craft was not complete formed when i did look up and it just sort of materialized into a full form after about 1 minute. I continued to view the object and was in hopes of some contact with its crew if able and had a small laser pen light key chain in my pocket with keys. I made a few flashes at the craft which wasn't to me very high maybe 500 yard off ground. The craft is the same shape and appeared exactly as one before happened when I was in 7th grade. The one then did not reflect sun light as it was in day light and it was only there maybe 2 minutes. This one made me think maybe they came back to communicate as it was exactly like my first sighting as a kid.  Wasn't lucky I guess!  The craft did not reflect the laser light or even show a beam from the light such as a metal object will do.  The only thing different about this sighting is that the time was much longer and to me it was only like a minute or two but when I went back into the house my wife asked what I was doing so long.  I said i just went outside to check the property and fence to be closed and didn't realize that ten minutes had elapsed. I will assume i have had my second encounter with the same craft again now.  Sure wish I could get some form of contact with them.  Has to be a reason why i now have seen this twice in my life. Guess I will never know for sure the reason but then again I might be a lucky person one day and be taken to the craft someway and fly through space with whatever life form is piloting this craft.  They have to be very intelligent to develop such a craft for great distance travel.  I don't think i was abducted but I do think I was somehow being close to the craft and observed by the craft changed in respect to time dilation of some sort as It didn't feel like the length of time I watched the craft was that long.  But it happened.\",\n",

I was taking photos using the passenger mirror. This is no trick.  Also I seen a orb on 12/3/2011 next to a charter plane.  Near Portland airport. Sighting Time:\\xa07:16pm Day/Night:\\xa0 Nighttime   No. of Witnesses:\\xa0 1 Duration:\\xa01 minute   Appearance / Description of Object(s)  cluster of 3 balls of light UFO in the sky behind us.   When I looked at it taking photo\\'s it was so blurry it was pulsating. Just all 3 big balls of light together.  No unusual sounds.  There were no beams at the time just what I described. It didn\\'t move by the photo\\'s. Size of Object(s)  The scale of the one light, comparing to a plane just over my head just about tree level was around the size of a street light.  There was no outline of wings of blinking lights nor a red blinking light. Description of Area / Surroundings We are near a think rural area.  Close to Route 112 about a block over.  There was no street light there or that even can be that height. Also the nearest airport is 3.5 miles.  It is a charter plane airport only. Full Description & Details I am educated in the UFO and abductions for 6 years now.  This year is the first experience I had 3 so far with in 2 months.  I am a amateur photographer as well and have a sharp eye. The family on 12/11/2011 stopped at a house full of lights.  It probably lit up the sky!  We are near a think rural area. We were near Route 112 north about a block over.  There was no street light there or that even can be that height. It was 7:16pm.  No moon. Clear sky, a few stars. We were listening to music.  Everything was working in the van and running.  I put down my window where it was a unusual warm December. I put the side window down.  The kids were pointing and looking out our van window. I thought it was cute so I took many photo\\'s less than 1 minute.  I do remember quickly, only because I was into watching and listening my kids. The object in the sky in the mirror was very blurry to the naked eye. It was pulsating. Just said to myself, what the heck is that. So I ignored it. The closet thing I can describe was a strobe light. I have seen all planes shapes and sizes. During the day and night. For 3 years I even lived next to a airport. I know it was no plane. There was no outline of wings of blinking lights nor a red blinking light. Just all 3 big balls of light together. No unusual sounds outside. I download them and always delete no good photo\\'s. To my surprise, there it was clear as day a I got 7 total with the mirror shot. The first one the UFO is not there. Then the next 6 in the mirror there is a cluster of 3 white lights, and what the camera got was a clear shot of it. Can sighting be explained as any conventional man-made or natural object? no, I seen them all in the sky night and day and know there sounds. I seen a commit and watch satellites as well. Witness Background I have my HS diploma. I took 2 year of business clerical. I flagged for about 3 years. I am a artist and photographer. I love details in all art work.

This year is the first experience I had 3 so far with in 2 months. my first was 2005. I was looking at stars and seen one \"star\" same color and size, move close to another \"star\" and at the same time they took off in a blink of an eye. I always believe, even as a child growing up in a sheltered life. I just know. I read all reports and books on the subject and want to work in this field down the road.

       "       'Because of my past history inside the craft (s) & (MILABS) this could be related to U.S. UFO/FLAP!!! While on the North/14 Antelope Freeway, myself passenger noticed a octagon shaped, while wife was driving the winding mountain range.  This craft seemed to pace the flow of traffic as we traveled north bound just prior to Acton CA a small township community which rest in a small bowl like valley.  At arms length this craft seem to be approx. the size of a standard house large ceiling air vent, at 500 feet high over the freeway.  The craft gave off a brillant array of white/ red/ (blue/green) colors.  I noticed a large spot light type light in front and to the rear of the craft, which may or may not be the direction of travel of this craft, as when I first noticed UFO it traveled in a north by north/west direction, within a split second it shot northbound out of sight approx. 1/4 mile only to return over our car in less than a second.  I open my sun roof in our ML-350 Mercedes Benz, and lost sight of the craft for a second or two but noticed the craft seemed to ! be pacing our car, I should make mention this SUV/ML-350 has radar function which may of helped the craft pace our car in the begining of the sighting and just prior to speeding forward the 1/4 mile, again hard to tell because of the octagon shape. Moreover, the spotlight in the front and end of the craft always remain on, the circumference of the craft displayed red lights over box like windows which were white, blue lights circled the craft.  This craft then traveled in a north/west direction and gave the appearance of rest on top of a medium size hill 1 & 1/2 miles away.  In conclusion, I have a history of childhood UFO abduction, inside the craft which was investigated by the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek, 1973 inturn my case was transfered to (MUFON) Beverly Hills, CA Mufon Chapter, investigators the Late Idabel Epperson and her investigator daughter Marylin Epperson. Finally, it should be noted in 1964/67 while serving my country as a United States Marine, Camp Pendleton, San Diego, CA I was subjected to a (MILABS) experience, along with other Marines, as we were taken via military bus with blacken windows & black curtains over the black painted windows. We went to a desert location where a UFO craft was housed.',\n",
       "       'Once again we forgot the event happened, until years later, looking back I realized we have missing time. 1977 Members of our family start discussing the UFO events in our life. Other family members have had their own experiences. But we are discussing the Fricot City event and our reaction during the event and afterwards, the next morning, (we as a family, all have had visits but have never been comfortable talking about those event even to each other.. Its an overwhelming feeling we arent suppose to speak about the visits! So we finally do, began asking each other why us, why the cover ups, what really going on, what the Aliens want with us, what does our family have that they need. When I was a child we lived in a car, traveling from one end of the west coast to the other including Oregon. We camped out a lot. But they still found us.! So we were contemplating how they knew our where abouts and seem to know every thing about us.  Other the years I have done research lots of reading and I learned about the implants from other abductees and it’s the only way the Aliens could have found us!! So the same night after our family discussion at my brothers house, (we had never told our children about The UFO until this night)  the kids and I are  going home, traveling  down hwy 12/88 as we approach the intersection of Hwy 12/88 we see lights in the alflefa  field next to the road,, red, green, blue, pulsating  lights appear in the field next to the road, one of the children ask if it’s a UFO, Im teasing the kids, we are all laughing and I tell then maybe, mean while the UFO is moving very very fast back and forth and I made a turn onto Tuttle Rd, the UFO passed over the car, the lights and engine died while the car is now moving in the dark night, when I become aware again the car is passing over the train tracks the lights and engine come back on.

       "       'early morning abduction / visitation on november21,2011  This event took place in my bed at my mothers house in the early morning hours of November 21, 2011.This is a report of an abduction by what I believe to be of alien origin. It began as a feeling of something approaching my bedroom and I thought that it was the family cat making his way to my bedroom. The house has hardwood floors and that makes it easy to hear footfalls approaching the room you’re in. The footfalls were very light and faint and that’s what made me think they were from the cat. The next thing I know the “cat” was on my bed and I could feel it next to my head. I thought it was strange that the cat was able to jump up onto the bed and get to the far side of my head with out me noticing him walking over there. The “cat which I will now call the ENTITY because I later believed that this is more closely a description of what was interacting with me. I tried to reach up with my hand and pet the “cat” but I could not feel him there . Next I felt him on my thighs and again I thought it strange that he could travel down to my legs without me noticing him walking down there. Once I felt him on my thighs I reached down to pet him again and once more he was not there , I could not feel him. The room was dark and I was underneath a down comforter and a light quilt as the event continued. My whole body was now underneath the covers and my hands were laying on my chest, my body laid out straight , and I was lying on my back, eyes open. The next thing I realize is a feeling of strange energy-like infused foggy mist forming above my bed. The darkness in the room was being lit up slightly by this energized fog. In my mind I felt a very weird feeling of confusion and a feeling of something taking over my thoughts in some strange way. I should say that words can’t accurately describe what exactly was going on inside my mind, so the reader of this should just bear with me on this description. The thoughts of the “cat” being on me was something I feel was a foreign thought being put in my mind to make me feel ok with what was going on. Again words can’t describe this feeling, I felt confused but not scared…YET. The very next thing that happened was a feeling of being stood up against a wall that had a depression in it the exact width of my body, with my hands at my side. This wall looked like wood grained paneling and my face was just a fraction of an inch away from touching it. The next feeling was that of motion. This motion was like the wall gave way and my whole body was moving forward into this wall, I was still standing as I moved into the wall. The motion continued forward then either up or down or I really cant say which way I was headed. The motion stopped and I felt like I was still in my bedroom though. The room I was in looked just like my bedroom, but I think that’s because this thought was being placed into my mind. The next thing I see is an object that looked like an elongated cell phone with a touch screen face on it. This object was about eight inches long and the width was about 2 inches across. The screen of this object was lit and had something like letters or symbols scrolling across it . The vision of this object was so clear and real to me that I began to really wonder what the hell was it doing floating above me . this device was floating above my left side  perpendicular to the bed surface facing to my right side. I then noticed that it was streaming a strange light up over my body to a point up on the wall to my right about a foot from the ceiling. Now this really puzzeled me and that’s when I began to feel panicked. It was right then that I felt that this was really happening and It was impossible that this could be going on. I then felt that I should try to grab this device and make it stop scanning me. I could not move a muscle, I found my whole body paralyzed, the onl! y way I was seeing this take place was through my eyes that could not move either. I could only see what was in my field of vision all the way out to my peripheral limits.This was enough to see the whole room wall to wall. I was very scared to find myself paralyzed with this device traveling the length of my body up and down . I decided to scream and see if that at least made my mother hear me and come rescue me from this madness. I tried to scream and nothing came out, I tried harder as I began to really panic, tears were streaming down my cheeks now and inside my mind I was screaming like a frightened child. I had the feeling that an Entity was in that room with me and they were not going to stop doing what they were doing. I couldn’t see any “person” holding that device but I was sure they were near and controlling the whole situation. I tried to scream one last time and this time I heard a quiet scream eminate from my mouth and echo in the room. Well this was enough apparently to scare away whatever was doing this to me. The device disappeared and the foggy mist was gone.  I thought to try to see if I was still paralyzed and thank god I could now move my arms and turn my head.  It was nothing like waking from a dream, it was like being released from a paralyzed state.  My eyes were open the whole time, and now I realized how frightened I was because the tears were wet on my face, I was shaking and I was out of breath. My next thought was to make my way out of bed before whatever it was came back and paralyzed me again. I was so scared like I never have been In my whole life. It took every bit of courage I had to get out of bed and run to my mothers room. I am a 50 year old man and I felt like a three year old running to my mommy for help. I did make it out of the bedroom and down the hall to her room. I spoke to her as I approached her room and she woke up and turned on her light to find me standing there shivering an! d crying asking her if she heard me scream.  She said no she did not hear me scream and what was goin on, why was I waking her up, what was the matter.  I thought this entity was just in the other room still watching me, so I was whispering that something weird just visited me in bed and that I thought it was still close by. We stayed in her room and talked about what happened for about an hour until I calmed downed. She tried to make me believe that it was a dream but I have had dreams and nightmares before and this was not anything like that. This essentially ends the event for the moment. It happened again about an hour later after I returned to bed, but that will be for a different time to report if at all because I can’t say for sure it wasn’t a bad dream caused by the original event…',\n",
       "       \"No one is able to believe I know no one is able to believe this, and this is just a record  Occurred : 6/30/1952     21:00.       I was living at ((address deleted)), Miami, Fl.  I was 8 years old. The UFO was watching me as I starred out my bedroom window. As It got closer I could feel them watching me, like they were probing my thoughts with a  great probing force.  I think they could feel I was scared and they mirrored back my feelings.  I  moved under the covers of my bed and became frozen unable to move. They took me out of my bed holding my wrists, were leading me down the hallway.  I screamed for my dad . Telegraphically they told me that he couldn't hear me, I believe everyone on my block was put to sleep. The saucer was round with a see through dome from the inside out. As they flew me to the mother ship, I remember vividly sitting down and afraid to let them think that I could see them.  I was scared and pretended not to see them.  There was one alien that wanted to communicate , maybe the navigator,  The two others were standing in back of him, watching and did not try to communicate ever.  We went to a larger ship.  I remembered the docking port. How we docked and getting on board.  The ship was larger inside that it appeared outside.  I had  physical tests with samples taken.  I remember the mesh floor and a small box next to the bulkhead, and the round top of the saucer fitting into the hole under the mother ship. I remember how big the ship was inside. They told  me when the tests began and over and over telepathically that it all would be over soon so just wait a little bit longer.. I think they populate other worlds with what they take, and  use you later on for reproducing a hybrid, from the two realistic dream/experiences, because I saw one recognizable abductee on TV., she was complaining about her experience of being used. I saw gray figures with no facial features separating and cloning DNA into multiple vials. They let me see the space view of the Gulf of Mexico at night, with the city lights from Orleans to Tampa.  They showed me a  ray gun that used static electricity.  The end of it had a shape similar to  a  filament that hangs electric wires from telephone poles.  I think if it misses your forehead it will make a light bulb break. All that happened when I was 8 years old in 1952 just before the UFOs flew over President Trumans Capital.

And she responded that I was crazy and seeing things, the light disappeared for a split second and it once again appeared, now not more than 100 ft. away, I asked her again did you see that? ,and she responded once again that I was crazy, so this time I had time to take 5 pictures which only 1 came out. The funny thing is my neighbor still does admit seeing it. The second time I really thought that the light was coming toward me, and I ask myself why is it that my neighbor couldn’t see it. I then had the strange feeling that I was going to get abducted. The light disappeared on an unvalibable speed to the west. I hav! e the the picture, and is clear that this was not a helicopter, or fireworks, take a look at the picture and you can see the landing gear, and something coming out of the the left bottom opening of the ufo, that created the light, see for yourself and be the judge of it.

       "       'My first sighting of a UFO On the night of December 6, 2011, as I am traveling North of Chestnut Ave. coming from Alluvial in Fresno, CA heading to Sonic to buy food for my son, I seen an unidentified aircraft coming at me.  It was around 8:30ish.  There were hardly any stars in the sky, it was dark.  There were no cars in front of me or behind me, but cars coming from my opposite direction.  As I was driving up North towards Nees Ave on Chestnut, I saw a light coming somewhat straight at me.  At first, the thought came to my mind that it is an airplane crashing down, I felt somewhat scared.  I did not want to witness anything extreme at that moment.  The flying object as it descended from the sky, started slowing down and got bigger.  As it was getting bigger and getting close to me (feelings: very scared), I began praying for it to stop or just be close enough that I could see it, but not close to me as to like being in front of me.  I really did not want to get abducted, that was the next thought in my mind.  The UFO aircraft stopped and hovered for a few seconds.  As I was staring at it, my thoughts were “Am I really seeing this?” the feelings of being shocked was trembling in my body.  My eyes were stuck at this unidentified aircraft, trying to figure out what this thing could look like, but all I seen was 3 circular lights, somewhat close together, shaped like a triangle, the lights looked as if it was spinning at a rapid rate, from red and blue, with traces of yellow light as it was glittering and spinning at a rapid rate.  The bottom of the craft looked like it had some rigid form structure around the lights. The UFO aircraft did not look large; it seemed somewhat medium/small size.  That was all that I seen from that... After a couple of seconds, maybe 15-20 seconds, it gradually started to move, to the right of my view, and curved up towards the sky.  It was lighting speed, it made traces of white light (like a tail of a star falling from the ! sky, except it was going up) as it ascended to the heavens.  I! never s een anything like it, or have I seen an aircraft as fast as that UFO craft traveled.  I’m still in shocked.  Today is December 8, 2011, 10:31AM.

I was outside looking up at the stars because one star was very bright and close and it caught my attention. Then I see a red light flashing very high up and close to this light I'm looking at it thinking to myself this air plane has to see the light I'm looking at since it is right next to it. The red light kept coming in my direction for about 1 minute getting lower and closer to me.The red light was flashing on and off about one time per second.As it got closer to me I noticed it was a triangle shaped dark gray object with a red light in the center.I would say maybe 80 ft long from corner to corner and 10 ft tall from top to bottom flying very slowly about 30mph.It had no wings and it made no noise.As it hovered directly over my head about 150ft above me the center where the red light was opened up.It was a circle right in the center of the craft that had 4 doors that opened up right over my head the red light disappeared and I saw a very bright white light inside the craft.You can not see inside the craft just the bright white light.It kept moving very slow past me and about 3 seconds later it closed the center up and the red light showed up again and it flew off in the same slow speed over the truck yard I was guarding.As it flew away I saw six small white lights on the rear of the craft on the bottom to top side.The lights were flashing from left to right very fast over and over.Anyone could have seen this craft it was very low and moving slow not hiding at all.I'm very afraid as to why it opened up like it was going to abduct me when it was over me.It looks identical to the triangle shaped ufo with the red light in the center with 1 light on each corner.Except the one I saw only had the red light on the bottom center no other lights on the bottom and small flashing lights on the rear.I could see carvings on the craft also it was not solid.I am not one to believe in s! tuff like this but now I have no doubt in my mind.I wish I wou! ld've ha d a camera ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

       "       'Possible abduction. Dear Mr Davenport,   Missing time on July 1st, was something I won\\'t forget, sitting on my front porch with husband at 7:45 pm, listening to music, hanging out.  Next thing we know we are in bed, we remember NOTHING. No memory, nothing.  Not even sure how we made it inside the house, everything was still on, stereo, TV, lights and the door was unlocked, which is not something we do.  I woke at 2:45 am totally confused, feeling all \"warped\" and the fear, fear very strong, but wasn\\'t sure why.I was naked,  I do not sleep naked, EVER. This was not the \"norm\" for me. When I woke, I had the most intense pain in my neck, shooting through my upper back and up through my head.  I reached around with my left hand to hold my neck and there is a \"bubble\" of sorts and it was very painful to touch.  I could not lay there as it hurt so bad, so I sat up, and became so nauseous, dizzy and still confused.  I got up, holding my head, as the pain was incredible.  Got my bearings and walked to the bathroom which is just out the master bedroom door, and I looked in the mirror, and saw not me, but a warped me, as in, I could see me, but I didn\\'t recognize the person staring back at me. I suddenly was overcome with even more dizziness and nausea,  I turned, and vomited like crazy for the next cpl hours.  My husband WOULD NOT wake up. I finally crawled back in bed 5 am after I went downstairs and locked the house, turned off the lights and was still very confused as to what happened.  My husband woke at 5 am, to feel the same way, only not vomiting, but very confused too, and not sure how or when we went to bed the night before. He is still VERY unsure what happened!   the whole next week I was terrified. beyond fearful.  I could not even go upstairs by myself to use restroom, take a shower alone in the house, NOTHING, I was so afraid.  We saw nothing, there is a void and it is eerie.  There is a feeling of being watched constantly. Thursday July 7th, again, I was sitting alone in living room, watching TV, and I was overcome by fear, I felt something was watching me again, I got very scared, (not like me at all) I sat there a few minutes only to hear a strange noise, not something I could identify, but I felt it from the upstairs, and I ran out of my house and to my neighbors house, I was scared again.  My husband was at work, I texted him to tell him I had a melt down and needed him.  He came home about 20 minutes later.  We sat and talked a bit, I calmed down, sorta.  Then we proceeded to bed to sleep. @ 11:30 pm.  I tossed and turned a bit, was very restless. It started at 0:30 am for me.  I was awake. I was lying in bed with husband, and I could feel fear, beyond fear, it was incredible to feel this way, though not a good way, but none the less, intense. husband rolled over onto his left side to go to sleep, I curled up behind him, and suddenly I could see these lights, little tiny lights, lines, shapes, all different colors, my heart began to race, and in my mind I could see flashes of \"monsters\" ugly ones, real strange looking.  I prayed so hard, I was so terrified, and yet I could only pray, husband was no longer awake and wasn\\'t going to wake, I KNEW that. Hubby wouldn\\'t wake up at all,  I was alone in this one. I felt a \"weird\" hand on my upper back, it rolled me over, I saw \"them\".  Three of them, two of them were a little smaller, with bits of stringy hair, they were at the foot of my bed, and one was taller, on the right side of me, and felt very \"powerful\" no hair, but the eyes, dark, ugly and very hypnotic.  My right hand was \"forced\" for better words down to my \"privates\" and my left hand was \"forced\" onto my chest.  I felt an odd heat coming over my body, and then I was \"forced\" to roll onto my left side, my knees were forced to my chest and my hands now forced across my abdomen.  I felt a sensation like never before.  My stomach was moving, literally. like a rolling sensation. I felt a heat between my legs, it was very warm and it was a rod like thing going inside me, a warm liquid came out of it, I could feel it.  Then I was rolled back over onto my back, and the big \"being\" had in it\\'s hands a small \"baby like\" being, I heard an incredible high pitched noise in my head.  Next ! thing I know I am waking at 5 am, I have an overwhelming sadness, tears coming out of my eyes, I KNOW, I just know I was \"visited\".  A knowing/feeling/sensation that won\\'t leave me.  BUT I am once again at peace, not afraid and no longer nervous, paranoid or anything, I am great actually.  Strange, I do not feel afraid. The next day, my nose, is sore,  It is still painful just to touch the right side of it, NOT sure why, but will be going to a doc to find out. Just and FYI, I have reported several eyewitness accounts to UFO sightings on your website, there were also witnesses, and I have called before due to another case involving my younger son,  I needed help, and was turned away. I want to KNOW what happened, and WHY!  thank you.',\n",

       "       'VERY LOW OBJECT w/ LIGHTS, sounded like helicopter, but WAS NOT! Circled several times. This evening, about 2:00am CDT, I was sitting on the couch watching TV when I heard what sounded like a helicopter circling the building really low.  I figured it was a helicopter going to the local hospital and dismissed it as not a big deal.  Then, I was still sitting there and heard it come back around again.  I turned off the window unit air conditioner to see if I could hear it better.  It was close.  I got up, opened the balcony door and looked outside and there was a dark cylindar-outline object with 2 lights on the rear, a red and a green one.  The red one was blinking, I think.  One of them was blinking.  There was also a spotlight on the front of the object.  The object also looked to have dark circles on the cylinder part that were just part of the craft itself, they were not lit up and hardly visible.  I screamed bloody murder to my girlfriend to wake up and to see what I was seeing.  She started to brush it off and was sleeping.  About that time! , I heard the sound of it fading back in towards me again.  Here it came again!  She got up this time and witnessed what I described above.  It was NOT a helicopter.  I thought it was when I heard it and even thought it still could have been after seeing it the first time because everything was so dark that I wanted to be really sure, but no, it was not a helicopter.  It was flying just as low as one though and when I first saw it, the cylinder dark part of it was facing slighting downwards, like it was looking for someone or something.  My girlfriend went back to bed, upset that she had to get up in a few hours, otherwise, I know she would not have wanted to miss the rest of this.  I stood there for a few seconds after it flew over that time and here it came again.  This time I knew it would.  I was excited and also kind of scared.  I had no idea what it was really doing, but it was astonishing to be so close to something that I could tell was not man-made.  When it came a! round this time, it started heading directly West, right towar! ds me, r ight towards my balcony door.  That\\'s when I saw it shift it\\'s light and knew that it did, in fact, have control over it\\'s headlight/spotlight.  It never pointed the light directly into my apartment, but it pointed it right over me and I know that whatever was inside of the object definitely, without a doubt, saw me.  I was freaked out at this point because I have heard stories and read things about abductions and I was just not ready at this time, if this is what was planned.  So, I freaked out a little bit.  The object was flying directly over the 3-story leasing house next door that is only about 15 feet away from my balcony.  There is only a small space in between my building and the leasing office (it\\'s a 3-story brick house).  The house has a chimney about 10 feet tall with an old antenna coming off of it that\\'s about another 3 feet.  The object flew RIGHT ABOVE the antenna.  I\\'m telling you this object was no more than 15 feet above my head.  At this angle, it appeare! d \"wider\" or \"fatter\" more like a soda can, than it had from seeing it from the side.  I had grabbed a notebook and pen during all this and had began making sketches of it and I can see it in my mind, but was finding it hard to draw it on paper.  I have the sketches and am about to try to draw them in Paint or something.  We have been seeing objects for weeks and have been making reports here and have contacted MUFON on a local level here to investigate.  They are usually silver cigar/cylinder shaped and make no sound and appear to glide across the sky, seeming to appear out of nowhere.  We have witnessed them traveling slightly faster and higher than airplanes with a contrail of 2 lines that runs very close together and parallel and we have seen them fly slower than airplanes, at the same higher altitude with no contrails or sound whatsoever.  Recently, we have seen them appear, flying faster than airplanes with the \"double contrail\" then slow down, and have ZERO contrail and still no sound.  All of these are cigar-shaped and I have emailed you guys a picture I drew this last week or so of one of these objects and what I have seen on them that sometimes looks like a \"fin\" or a \"straw\" type of object stemming from the cylinder itself.  They are usually so high it\\'s hard to make out what\\'s on ! the object.  We have also noticed when it starts to get dark around 8:25pm, these same objects have a visible blinking red light on the top of them, sometimes in the middle of the cylinder and we have also seen them towards the tail end.  Tonight, we wanted to see if we could see them after dark, so we went out around 10pm and observed several of these objects in the sky at the same time... 2 or 3 sharing the sky at the same time within our field of view (which is limited from our balcony because of the house next door and trees across the street and we absolutely cannot see West or North at all).  These objects blinked erracticly like red/red/white/red/red/red/white/white/red/white/red/red/red, flashing brightly.  I also want to add after the close encounter highlight event of this evening/morning, I did actually see a REAL helicopter through the window, with the door closed, and was actually unable to hear it at all whatsoever.  To me, this is proof that this other object was even louder than a normal helicopter and certainly much lower.  Last, but not least, this may be the weirdest part in all of this, but hopefully you guys know how often we see this things now.  Well, sometimes when we are out watching them, I kind of say to them (the objects) that I wish they would come closer or lower so that we can view them.  I know this is going to sound really, really crazy, but it almost like this object wanted us to see it.  I did not witness anyone outside during this commotion of this craft, nor did I hear or see anybody afterwards.  It is like a desert town outside.  It is eerily calm and quiet.  I also want to add, although I do not fully know its significance, that last week sometime (not sure of the day) around 1 AM, I was sitting up by myself watching TV while my girlfriend was asleep.  I heard a very loud and very close BANG! right outside my window.  I then saw a flash of light right after it happened.  It was so sudden, so unexpected, so immediately unexplainable as anything natural at all, that my heart sank to my stomach and it began pounding.  I was so scared, I was literally frozen and did not know what to do.  Once I calmed down, I looked outside and decided that maybe somebody had busted a lightbulb out or something like that, but that doesn\\'t even make sense either.  It was much louder than that and certainly on my level (the 2nd floor) and close enough that my neighbor lady on my level would have heard it and the guy that lives below her.  It was still after that.  No sound, nothing.  I told my girlfriend about it the next day and there was nothing out! side at all to remotely explain the sound.  Nothing was broken.  There were no large holes in anything.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  Until last night, around the same time I heard the noise before, around 1:20am, there was a loud BANG! boom, boom. then a rumble that lasted for a couple seconds.  This was NOT lightning.  It was not thunder.  It was not storming.  There were no rain clouds.  There was nobody outside.  Everything was still.  This scared the crap out of my girlfriend and it was almost like I didn\\'t even flinch this time, even though it sounded like a shotgun went off outside my window and not even both of our windows, only one window.  That\\'s how localized this sound was.  So, this evening before I heard the helicopter sound, I had looked at the clock at around 1:50am and decided that I guess we weren\\'t going to hear that noise again tonight.  We had agreed to pay attention to the time in case it happens again (not that you wouldn\\'t hear it), but she went to ! bed and I was still up and didn\\'t hear anything.  It wasn\\'t ev! en 10 mi nutes later when the helicopter noise began.  I hope you guys can make some sense of all of this.  I\\'m just along for the ride here, apparently.

       "       'This is regarding a possible abduction when I was a caretaker on a 40 acre farm in the ozarks.   I was alone at the time and in the middle of sleep.  I woke up and saw the room I was sleeping in however, there were two beings in the room.  I could sense that one was a male and the other female.  The male was tucking me in bed and was a dark brown figure around 5\\' 10\" with pointed ears.  I could not make out a face.  I was not afraid, but somehow felt that everything was ok.  The other one that I could sense was female was around the enterance of the bedroom.   Then I fell back asleep as he was tucking me in.  When I came to awake again in the middle of the night, I jumped out of bed since I had remembered what had happened and ran to the kitchen to see what time it was, it was around 2:30 AM.  Maybe a week or so later I had a scoop mark in my right top hip, about a inch and a half was the circumference. I had seen activity in the sky prior to that night, perhaps a few weeks prior.  There were many star like crafts moving around in the sky.  I had somehow gotten crazy enough to get a flashlight and shine it up at the sky to see if any would respond.  Well, one started coming closer to the house from where I was shining the light.  Well, I was so freaked out by that and had run into the house and turned off all the lights and was frightened. I sort of had a connection since I was around 8 years old.  There was missing time when I was 8 or 9 years old.  I remember going to bed and my bed was centered in front of a window on the second floor.  I shared a room with my two other sisters.   Well, I closed my eyes to go to sleep and I just blinked them open and it was the next day.  Maybe it was some weierd sleep thing.  But I never had anything like that happen to me since.  I remember telling my mom about it after I woke up and how strange it was to me, but she did not think anything of it of course.  But I still remember that.  I have dreams about seeing ufo\\'s.  I grew up next to the jackson barraks in new orleans. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

       "       'Two stationary crafts in the sky blinking green lights to each other   Twenty years ago I lived in a small apartment in Buena Park, California.  It was around 10:00 p.m.  on a cold January night and I decided I would have one last cigarette before I went to bed.   I went outside.  My apartment is the first unit off the street.  While smoking, I looked up into the night sky.  The clouds parted and I saw two objects in the sky.  The  first was  a huge object with lots of widows with green lights coming out of the windows.  The lights were blinking on and off as if it was a code.   The second object was the same shape as the first, only smaller.  It also had blinking green lights.  To me it looked like they were communicating to each other. I felt happy and excited that I was witnessing this event.  I did not think I was seen or that these objects knew anyone was watching.  I did not speak of this event to anyone. Recently I went to my doctor for sinus problems.  He ordered an x-ray.  X-ray showed a \"screw\" shaped  item in the top of my head.  I have never had surgery on any kind on my head.  My doctor sent me to see a surgeon.  Surgeon stated he could not remove this item because the procedure would be to painful and he would not do it. For some reason, I started thinking about the UFOs I saw all those years ago.  I have had some flashes of memory.  I remember being very close to the ship and feeling very frightened.  I believe I was abducted. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident in January 1991 is approximate.  PD))',\n",
       "       'My husband, son and I were outside and my husband said what the **** is that?    So my son and I stood up and I noticed a triangle shape of lights with orange/reddish lights coming towards us from the North, going south.  It was moving very slowly.   It was about 30 feet from the ground.  It almost blended in with the sky; if it wasn’t for the dim reddish lights I wouldn’t have seen it.   As it went by extremely silent I tried looking at the flying craft itself; the triangle was semi-invisible, you could see a triangle shape but not every detail.   Pardon the pun but like the clocking device on star track when they first start to go invisible or when they are taking the clock down.   It felt like I was dreaming while I watched this craft go by us, then it glided more to the South past us and it was it disappeared into the sky because of its black color and dim lights.  We couldn’t see it any longer. When it was gone all I could keep saying was that was amazing.   My son started saying he didn’t want to be abducted, he was frightened after seeing that.  My husband and I were in amazement.  I drew a picture of what I saw.  The picture isn’t a perfect image of it  I am not an artist but it’s what we saw that night, we will never forget.',\n",
       "       'ICBM Sites Augusta, Montana 1:00 A.M.  brilliant lights, greenish red orb, with no contrails on vanishing. The event occured outside of Augusta, Montana on May 26, 1:00 A.M.  The area where I was staying is dotted with ICBM sites that are in eyesight of the road leading to the cabin.   The closest site to the cabin I believe was roughly 20 miles as the crow flies from the cabin.  I also believe that numerous other ICBM sites exist in the area that are sub Terra.   Six of us were sitting around a campfire, when a large reddish greenish glow started to crest the hill which leads down to the property.  We were staring uphill from a lower location looking up the road as the light crested the hill.  When a vehicle drives at night, which is rare anyways out there, the light does not crest the hills, the dips between the roads blocks out all night until the vehicle crests the top.  The light we saw was roughly 80-100 yards away.   Our first thought was that we were not witnessing a vehicle at all, but aurora borealis.  I remember a friend saying its aurora, but i fiercely d! oubted this accusation as the object grew brighter and showered the beam across the 4 acre property.  The object on the hill became glowing with a greenish purplish hue, that flooded the entire area we were staying in.  It illuminated all the trees behind us upwards to over one hundred yards.  The light seemed to expand over the entire area, then began to pulsate with tremendous colored light.   Six of us distinctly remember the intensity of the light and its changing color structure.  I remember staring directly at the object, then having the desire to walk towards it.  Not in an abduction sense, but more so a mix of curiosity and some sort of draw towards it.   My friend and I began to run towards it with his German Shepard.  As we started running to the top of the hill the orb pulsated and vanished.  No contrails, nothing at all, just turned itself off and vanished.  Since I was running up to the craft, my friend that was stationary said that the object had a center where ! the light was radiating out from.   What happened after the UFO left was also very interesting.  Every single one of us said we could feel some sort of energy within our bodies.  It was a very intense feeling, and it was not nerves or adrenaline.  It was as if my body was charged up or another state of awareness.  Everyone I was with said they could feel this feeling as well, upwards to an hour.   Within twenty minutes of the sighting, we noticed two planes flying overhead at low altitude with no lights at all.   Just two planes within a minute of each other, jet black, and not a single emitting light.  One of my friends who was in his tent at the time of the siting, said he felt an intense light pulse through the tent and that he could feel the presence of something hes never felt before.  The dog in his tent, had erratic behavior after and during the light.   The following day on the road out, we witnessed more U.S. Government plates on SUV vehicles than I have ever seen in a population of 287 people.  At first I was not going to post my encounter, but after reading countless reports of minutemen and other military personnel that were stationed in the exact same area, and reporting exactly and very close to what I saw, I changed my mind.   I believe ICBM sites are the main focus of these lights people have been seeing since the Cold War.  The incident at Maelstrom AFB really made me interested, and an avid believer that nuclear power and ICBM are of great interest to whatever is out there.',\n",
       "       'A Strange Night At Summer Camp... In 1966 I was 8 years old.  At sleep away summer camp {Surprise Lake near Cold Springs NY on the old Cornwallis estate}. I had a strange night.  After the day\\'s activities we returned to our bunk on a forested hillside. There was a light shinning through the window that normally was not there.  My four bunk mates and I did not really think anything of it because it actually illuminated the whole cabin which was normally dark and kind of scary. It was in the woods below a place on the hill side called \"Bald Spot\" a patch of granite where no trees grew. We figured a counselor must have set up a flood light out side. We all fell asleep. That night I dreamed two figures were standing over me looking down at me. On the left was a typical &quot;Grey&quot; with almond shaped eye shades and on the right, a round headed, round faced and round eyed looking dude with a mouth stuck in the position like he was saying \"oooo.\" The &quot;Roundy Round&quot; had on like a sombrero that made him look Mexican. The &quot;Grey&quot; had on a silver space suit. The &quot;Grey&quot; had a long probe/rod with a round glowing orb at the end of it that he inserted into my forehead all the way to the back of my skull. They then looked at each other. The &quot;Grey&quot; pulled the probe back out of my forehead and showed the still attached glowing orb to the &quot;Roundy Round&quot; They both looked at each other bewildered, like &quot;I guess we got him already!&quot; and moved across the cabin to my sleeping bunk mates, visiting each one. The &quot;Grey&quot; inserted the rod into their forehead, and when he extracted it the orb that had been on the end of the rod stayed in their heads!  Next the &quot;Grey&quot; and the &quot;Roundy Round&quot; waited at the doorway as all my bunkmates arose like they were sleep walking, and followed them out of the cabin into an intense white light. I pulled the covers over my head. I figured this is just a neat dream and fell back asleep. For some reason I was not afraid. We all awoke the next day as if nothing had happened. The Very next evening the counselors created an unusual activity for us. They blindfolded our whole encampment{20 kids}. They marched us through the early evening to a geodesic dome structure that was an indoor basketball court. This they artfully transformed into an alien space craft using aluminium foil, crepe paper streamers, strobe lights and the creepiest rock music they could muster on a portable phonograph. We sat along the inside perimeter of the dome and the counselors who were made up and dressed up as &quot;Aliens&quot; proceeded to abduct us. I was in on this as one of three volunteers that helped the counselors decorate the geodesic dome &quot;Spacecraft&quot; in preparation for the activity. I had been sworn to secrecy!  Now after about a half an hour of this event the counselors had to call it off, as most of my bunk-mates where being frightened to tears by what was going on. Some of them actually screaming for their mothers in terror! The counselors could not even console them by showing them it was all a hoax, and quickly had to evacuate the dome to get the children to the safety of the mess hall!  In retrospect I realize now that the whole encampment-19 kids and 5 teen-aged counselors were actually abducted the night the light shined through the window. The next night the light was gone!  The night in question I was left in bed because &quot;I was already implanted or they could not implant me for some reason&quot; The very next day the counselors subconsciously reenacted the whole event. At that time I actually felt left out, because they left me behind. In retrospect I was the lucky one.',\n",
       "       \"Hovering saucer with blinking lights interacts with signals from flashlights. This sighting took place in the spring, around 1974, near Brooksville, Maine. My friend and I were going smelt fishing around 8 or 9 pm. We walked through the woods to Walker's Pond and the inlet where we were going to fish. I carried a large cell flashlight, like an electric linesman would use. It was dark enough to need the light to watch your step along the path. There were other fishermen were positioned around the pond, we could faintly hear them talking and occasionally see their flashlights, but we were the only people fishing on the other end of the pond. As we approached the waters edge, I noticed flashing, colored lights off to my right. I said out loud, &quot;What the hell is that?&quot;, my friend said &quot;I don't know.&quot; The other fishermen were too far away and from their angle could not see into the small cove where the lights were. We watched it for about a minute when I decided to blink the flashlight at it. Suddenly the lights began moving silently toward us, hovering just above the water. I could plainly see it was a saucer shaped craft, approx. 70 to 100 ft. wide, there was a dome-like bubble on top. The lights were going around the edge under the craft, yellow, red and white. I thought I could see shadows in the dome part. I was freaked out and said to my friend let's get out of here! He agreed, we were standing right beside each other as we turned to run. I took about 3-4 steps and fell down. I immediately got back on my feet and called to my friend, silence. He didn't answer, which I found very odd since he had been within 5 ft. of me not 30 secs. before. I called again and he answered me from about 100 yds. away. He made his way back and asked what happened. I was confused and didn't know what had taken place. As we regrouped to make our way out of the woods, we suddenly realized all the fishermen on the pond were gone. There was no one fishing, they had all left.Normally fishermen would be there until 2 am. My friend and I cannot account for the time that we lost that evening. We don't know if we were abducted, but somehow a period of time is unaccounted for from that night. I'm a 59 yrs old male, ex-Marine, not given to hallucinations or visions. This experience has stayed with me my entire life and have wanted to be hypnotized or regressed to find out about that night but haven't actually done it. My friend who also witnessed this, died about 15 yrs. later. I will tell you this, after my experience, I KNOW Ufo's are real and I believe others who tell their stories. I recently learned about the Allagash Abductions and was very interested because that group of abductees also flashed their light to attract the saucer. Their event also took place in the 70's. We both signaled the saucer with a blinking light! Weird! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))\",\n",
       "       'Floating abduction out of bed into a silver saucer; US military human beings on board, some kind of head surgery performed   I was fast asleep when I suddenly woke up and appeared to be floating above my house!  Why do I know that all this that follows was not simply a dream?  It didn\\'t feel like a dream, I felt I was awake but out of normal condition.  Consider this, in a dream state I seem to accept everything that happens no matter how bizarre as \\'real\\' but in this incident and all during it I was continually rejecting it, thinking that \"this was impossible, this can\\'t be happening,\" and as each level unfolded I continued to be confounded at the content. In short,  I could evaluate which is a higher order of thinking that is beyond dream awareness. Anyway, the impossibility got worse as I am somehow transported (floated) up to a classic silver flying saucer! I clearly remember seeing the hull out of the dark, where the two ends converge and I am absolutely stunned, thinking, what the?  This can\\'t be happening!  That is a flying saucer!  This thing was parked above our house in the dark but I could see it in the dark. And at the next instant I am inside! I see what appears to be a human military man American, I presume, I don\\'t know the words he is saying but I sense his anger, this man is extremely angry about something.  I later believe that he was possibly mad that I am awake because I may have said something to him or he could see my eyes were open!  I am aware of other human beings United States Military men on board.  I don\\'t seem to be walking or I can\\'t feel my legs.  I am transported into the center of the craft and put on a table on my back and doctors surround me and immediately commence brain surgery!  My mind seems to be cracked open and I am seemingly transported to another area, larger space and I feel at this time very afraid as it has gone from impossible to unfathomable and I am simply overwhelmed and feel as if I am a whimpering thought of &quot;bodylessness&quot; (a ghost of some kind)!  This operation seems I can hear others conversing but the words are not understandable,! but I can sense their communication amongst themselves. This is the longest period of time and is fuzzy as to details. After some time I seem to lose all consciousness and after more time I wake up in my bed the next morning. The sun is shining and I begin another day at work! But I have immediate recall of the above and I am simply befuddled as to how to understand it. I was shocked by it all! It all had a very real unreal feeling about it but I could not be sure. For the next 30 years or so I would never discuss this with a single soul. I was too scared to admit it for anyone would think I was nuts! The book Communion had a line that solidified for me that it may indeed be real with the line &quot;...and they implanted something in my brain...&quot; after that I was a wreak for the next year or so trying to accept its reality. Finally after 5 or 10 years and then seeing the culture start to talk about this kind of thing (the Simpsons had scenes of people being abducted u! p into space ships and more people started coming out with sim! ilar sto ries) then I started to lighten up about it. Now I can freely discuss it without too much distress.  Some interesting points: The album cover by Emerson Lake and Palmer really keyed me in at the time: &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot; that painting depicted very well what I felt was similar to the experience in some form. There was a robotic feeling about it.  The man in the ship, I later saw a photo of General Curtis Lemay and I swear the fellow on board looked so much like that man that I think it was him!  At that time (1975) there had not been any reports of anything like this happening to people, being sucked up into a flying saucer! Surgery?! So I was not influenced by anything from the culture, this was totally new and totally unexpected.  I was apparently unharmed. Just a bit freaked out as we say! No physical evidence was noted on myself, I didn\\'t even look for any.  That is about it, I wanted to report it officially somewhere so it can go into the record. I don\\'t seem to have any recollection of anything like this happening to me before or since. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))',\n",
       "       'Possible alien encounter and or abduction in 1993   Ok, where to start?  First let me say that I am sorry for waiting so long to report this “officially” as it never occurred to me to do so until today. This “event” and possible “abduction” happened while I was in the military and home on leave. I don’t recall the exact date or even the month but I do remember that it happened in 1993 and it wasn’t cold outside yet, there were still green leaves on the trees so it was in between the months of May to September. My parents lived in Lusby, Maryland at the time and I was home on leave for the weekend. They had left for the weekend to visit family and I had the house to myself.  No one was home but me. Being in the military (Navy) trained me to not need an alarm clock.  I was up by 6 a.m. every day (weekends too) without the use of ANY alarm clocks at all.  I never could sleep in even if I wanted to. I should say right now that I am relatively light sleeper and a lucid dreamer, that being said, I don’t believe that my encounter was a dream in any way.  I just wanted to mention that to show that what happened to me that night was something different than ANY lucid dream I had EVER had…  Please do not dismiss what I am about to say based on what I have admitted to.  In fact, I would like to get to the bottom of this once and for all to understand that what happened to me that night DID in fact happen.  So here’s my encounter:   I went to bed that Friday night at around 10 p.m. or 2200 hrs if you wish.  I don’t recall what time it was but at some point in the night I was roused to consciousness by what appeared to be very bright flashlight type lights being shined on my bedroom window.  They were bright enough to light my entire room.  Needless to say, I got up and went to the front door to see who it was shining those bright lights at my bedroom window.  When I opened the door I couldn’t believe what I saw…  I saw a craft, maybe 40’ in diameter that looked like a yoyo only flatter.  By that I mean it looked like two saucer shaped craft that were joined in the middle about two thirds of the way in.  The outer most edges of each half of the craft had a row of lights around them as well.  This may sound strange but I can’t remember whether the lights were multi colored or white.  The craft hung just above the tree line over the dirt road in front of the house and it was giving off the purest of white ! blue light from the bottom of the craft that fanned out beneath it.  There was also a sort of sparkle or electricity to the light. Now THIS is where it gets “different” for me.  Inside of this brilliant light was standing a tall skinny being with very long “bony” for lack of a better word, legs and arms with hands that had long bony fingers that seemed a bit out of proportion to the rest of the body.  I can’t remember if the being was clothed or not (don’t know why but I don’t).  I can tell you that it had a humanoid head with eyes that were VERY human, very thin lips and a thin almost nonexistent nose.  What also struck me odd about this being is that it had what looked like very long hair, only it was real thick, almost like dread locks but not nearly as messy…  So I am standing in my front door looking at this craft/light and being standing on the dirt road looking at ME and I am thinking to myself that I should run!  But where too?!  I don’t know where to go… I am paralyzed with fear.  I want to run so badly…  But then I hear a voice, not out loud, but IN MY HEAD!!! It says to  me, “Don’t be afraid.”  “You have no reason to be afraid.”  And all at once, I was calm.  I told myself, “I have nothing to be afraid of….”  And that was that. Just before waking up/coming to the next morning I had flash backs to when I was a child living in Fort Washington, Maryland and standing in my back yard looking up at the very same craft only this time it had what the voice in my head called  a “companion craft” with it.  All I saw of the companion craft were its lights and that the lights were in the shape of a triangle and that it moved around the main craft. (Totally unrelated to this story but possibly relevant is the fact that I also suffered from “missing time” while living there as a child)   Anyway, like I stated above, no matter what day it was, whether I had duty or it was an off day or weekend, I ALWAYS woke up at 6 a.m. NO EXCEPTIONS.  I NEVER slept in.  Except for this Saturday, I didn’t wake up this Saturday until 10:30 ish and I felt drugged.  VERY disoriented and a bit unstable (walking wise) and my nose hurt and was a bit bloody.  One nostril more so over the other. I believe it was my left nostril but I can’t recall.  I just know that when I woke up it felt like at some point I had my whole finger shoved up my nose. Now, some years later, I think it was 2003, I had a full body MRI done just out of curiosity.  No medical reason what so ever, just a company offered it as a means of early detection of heart disease or cancer.  So I paid to have the scan done.  I was shocked to be told that I have a small mass on one of my lungs (I should know which one but I don’t.)  I can get medical records of the scans though as I have had a scan done on the mass three times now to “monitor” its possible growth and it has shown no sign of change. Now, I was told by one doctor early on that they were a bit confused as this mass was not “calcified” so it should be growing in size at least slowly but since it isn’t doing anything they were not going to biopsy it so as not to provoke it…  Anyway, the most recent scan was within the past 12 months and there still has been no change in whatever is in my lung. I don’t know if the mass in my lung and the encounter I had are related but I thought I would add that in just as a side. In conclusion, I hope that my account can be of some assistance to you and maybe someone can assist me in trying to determine if this was a dream or reality.  I would have chalked it up to just a dream if it weren’t for the way I felt and the time at which I woke up Saturday, or the fact that my nose was bloody and sore. Thank you for your time.

I was asleep in my room then awoke and felt like I immediately needed to get up and do something so I got up to go smoke a cigarette in my garage because it had been cold outside for the past two weeks but as I got closer to the garage door I heard a voice in my head say &quot;YOU NEED TO GO OUTSIDE&quot; So, I said speaking a pond what I had just heard&quot;YOUR RIGHT LET ME GO OUTSIDE&quot; so I turned around and went out my back door and as I stepped out the door I noticed that the sky was crystal clear it appeared as if every star in the sky was visible. As I looked to the left I saw what appeared to be something like a rainbow it was purple and pink and it sat right above a tall tree in my neighbor's back yard. It looked like a snakes body when it slithers but not going from West to East but from South to Nor! th above the tall tree and it also appeared as if it was transparent so I said to my self thinking what is that I've never seen that before. Then I looked off to the right of me still scanning the sky hoping I would see a UFO but I didn't so I turned back to look at the strange colors thinking I'm going to watch whatever this is to see if it disappears or fades away and as soon as my eyes locked on the strange colors a circular ball of light surrounded by a neon green and blue gas or plasma substance which stayed around the helicopter sized craft the entire time shot out at super sonic speed and made a complete stop the craft hovered for app 10 seconds and then started to move really really slow to the right of me for about 7 to 10 seconds before shooting off in super sonic speeds without making a sound and left behind 6 circles that look like smoke rings with lines in between each of them. As I turned my head the object appeared to be coming back in the opposite direction ! except this time it appeared to be far out with the stars and ! traveled out as far as I could see within 5 seconds so by this time i was crying like a baby because I couldn't believe what had just happen to me so I stepped up on my stairs to the house and looked up to the sky and asked &quot;GOD IF THAT WAS MEANT FOR ME AND IF YOU MEANT FOR ME TO SEE THAT WOULD YOU PLEASE SHOW ME ANOTHER SIGN? And as soon as I said that a smaller circular ball of light flew right over my house lower than the UFO with noun of the same characteristic as the UFO except for how bright and illuminated they both were.  couldn't handle it any more so while still crying and in complete shock I went in my room and laid down and felt such a sense of peace that I had a smile on my face from ear to ear and it felt like I was dying and leaving my body then I blacked out within a minutes or less saying oh my GOD oh my GOD. Then I woke up around 10:30am the next morning looking around thinking OK I'm in my room and I jumped up thinking to my self oh my GOD that really did happen to me last night so while in the shower I felt a bump underneath my right arm pit and quickly got out the shower to look at whatever it was knowing that it hadn't been there the morning before or months before or years prior to the event that took place last night. The bump appeared to have a oval black burn mark in the center. The bump went down after two years but now you can clearly see a whole and what appears to be an object perfectly placed in the center where the black mark once was. It is still underneath my arm as ! of this day and it is going on 6 years now. It appeared as if I was burnt by a laser or injected with a hot needle at first but now it appears as if I was implanted with something that Dr Roger Leir studies but it has never caused me any discomfort. All I want is some help so I can understand what happen to me that night. This is my honest to GOD truth.

       "       'Our family abducted by aliens near Stoughton, Wisconsin in Summer of 1966  500 Lights On Object0: Yes All of the info was obtained either in hypnotherapy sessions or by a method of self-hypnosis taught to me by the hypnotherapist.  I am putting all of the events together in somewhat chronological order. I feel this event occurred when I was about 5 or 6 years old while our family was driving from our home in suburban Chicago, Illinois.  My mom\\'s parents owned a resort on a lake in northern Wisconsin. We used to leave our house in the early hours of the morning on these family trips in the Summer. Under hypnosis I recalled the events basically beginning like this.  Seeing a huge ball of light in front of us. As if the moon had come down out of the sky.  The light was all contained within the big globe of light. It did not refract like a flashlight or other kind of light. I also recall seeing curved kind of diamond shaped different colored lights reflected either on the windshield or on the dashboard. Our car was stopped on the side of the road.  Behind our car dow! n the road there was a blue light. There were three tall figures silhouetted coming from that light toward our car. I was very upset at this point in the hypnotherapy.  Then there was a figure at the driver\\'s window. It looked like someone with an orange monkey face.  He reached in through the open window and did something with the ignition or steering wheel. I was not upset at all about this but very calm. I recall seeing my dad either staring straight ahead in a daze or slumped over the wheel.  Then several of us (Mom from the passenger seat directly in front of me; brother a year younger; sister two years younger than me; and myself) were taken from the vehicle and led by very tall beings whom I cannot completely recall. Our baby sister was in her carseat in the back and we left her behind. She was crying. One of the beings picked up my sister 2 years younger than me. She touched it\\'s face. I could not recall what the face looked like. A being took my hand in its hand and l! ed me out of the car. The closest I can describe the feeling o! f its ha nd is like those rubber toys that have the wires inside and how they feel when you bend them. Its fingers felt like that. Then we were inside the craft. It was sectioned like orange sections inside in crescent shapes. The floor had kind of ribbed raised strips and was like foam rubber. It was gradually curving just like an orange section would be. There was a man who was standing on the side of an entrance. He looked like a movie star. His skin color was pink but extreme pink like carnation pink. Not a natural human pink skin color. He was wearing what looked like a snowmobile suit. Then I looked again and in his place was some kind of robot or metal kind of statue with a base and a pole and top like for a head. I then saw my mother laying down. She was rubbing the right side of her head. Then I saw my brother laying down and he was also rubbing the right side of his head. I did not see my sister on board the craft. Then I was laying down. They took something and shoved it u! p my right nostril and I felt a pain like a headache on the right side of my head and I rubbed my head as well. I could not \\'see\\' the beings standing around me very well at first. But since that time I have had more information come to me and they were what I would call \"The Whites\". Their skin is chalk white. They have big eyes like fish eyes and they have large appendages on the sides of their heads like big ears. They wear clothes which are black and shiny like the cloth is of spun shiny metal. Thinking about that cloth gives me a creepy feeling. They pulled down my pants and used a sharp object on me. During that time I thought they only touched the end of my penis with it. But since that time it has come to me that they shoved it up inside the shaft. It was a long needle. That is all I have recalled about being on the ship. I have a vague memory of being back in the car and nobody saying anything for quite some time. And dad also just driving silently for a ways before! we gradually started talking again and being I guess aware of! where w e were.',\n",
       "       \"A brief encounter with an Unidentified Flying Object, belief is near-abduction sighting. Hello, before discarding this report('tis a bit on the crazy side) know that this was in a dream, which was so realistic, the shock of the ending made me wake up, which also makes me doubt the 'dreamstate' I was in. Ok. So I was having a dream and was nearing the end of the dream, when suddenly an Unidentified Flying Object was visible in the sky. There was only a split-second before I and my companions who were travelling with me were all surrounded by a beam of some sort, of which I do not know, and the ground began to tremble, as if an earthquake had just begun. Then, we all began to float upward. The light emitting from the beam was blinding; I wasn't able to see anything outside the beam. As we neared the Unidentified Flying Object, I began convulsing without control, which I believe was a seizure, and was so strong it woke me up. The seizure also carried into when I woke up(about for a second) and I do not have any medical conditions related to seizures. Everything beyond this point is purely speculation, and is an opinion, and entirely non-fact based. Ok. I believe my dream from point of 'abduction'(Abducton - An act of being taken from a point without your consent or free will)to point of seizure was real, due to the vividness of the dream, I almost also could not tell when I crossed a reality threshold of having the seizure and being in my bed. It was like I was just suddenly there. I've never believed in extra-terrestrial existence, but I do now. I was completely skeptical and made aliens look completely impossible in the eyes of my friends, but it happened just an hour or two ago, and forgive my franticness, but I'm afraid I will forget or something. I do not know. I believe it could have been a device which would invert the gravitational pull of a living being from the Earth's gravitational pull to a gravitational push. In essence, a functioning tractor beam to only pick up living beings. The power needed to pull off such an extraordinary feat would require, in my belief, the equivilancy of a 100-Megaton Nuclear Bomb(Using our conventional technology).I've been skeptical of aliens all my life. I do not know if it was 'aliens'. It could have been a government test or something. I have no idea. But this was easily the most radical thing I've witnessed in my entire life. If you've read this all the way through. Thank you for reading my story, because I didn't think I'd live to tell it.\",\n",
       "       'Transported to a beautiful world with benevolent beings   My experiences are always an extremely vivid dream, and I have had multiple follow up dreams as well.  Every fiber of my being tells me that my experiences were real.  I am not a ufo enthusiast by any means, and have always believed abduction stories, for the most part, are the result of an overactive imagination or mental/physical disorders.  Here is my story:  The first time I had the experience, I never experienced the actual abduction or saw any kind of spacecraft.  All of the sudden, myself and maybe four other humans were in some kind of adminstration building with windows all around, with a huge table in the middle of this stainless steel like atrium.  We were all terrified, and scattered to find a hiding place;  we had no idea how we got there, or who anyone else was.  We never saw the alien beings either!  Me and another human male hid in a closet.  There were no words spoken the entire time, not sure why.  All of the sudden, I wasn\\'t afraid anymore, and ventured out into the atrium once again.  I walked to the big table in the center of the room, and some kind of a being or presence was showing me, telepathically, the secret to faster than light travel and their alphabet.  I was amazed, no longer afraid, just...awed!  Afterwards, I was lead, telepathically, outside of the atrium to their world.  It was beautiful beyond my ! imagination:  two suns; one brilliant blue sun on the horizon and another red sun on the other horizon.  The world around me had a desert coloring to it, but there were strange plants in the distance.  I was telepathically told that my time was up.  It is at this time that I woke up in my own bed, feeling like I had been blessed by god.  I was able to draw some of their alphabet, but had no idea what it meant.  I was also able to recreate the diagram for faster than light travel.  This experience has stuck with me throughout the years.  The second time I had this experience, I suddenly found myself looking at the beautiful horizon with the two beautiful suns.  I wasn\\'t afraid at all, but so humbled and excited that I was back!  Once again, I never saw the alien(s), but was able to understand, and realize that there were several beings near me, that meant no harm.  It is like someone was speaking over a radio directly into my brain.  Once again, I am unable to speak with my voice, but these beings must have been able to read my thoughts and emotions, because I got a tour of this facility.  As I am walking through the atrium, I notice the ceilings are over 30 feet high, the walls curved and there were no straight lines.  It was all a stainless steel looking structure.  Very interesting!  I walked past glass window, where I saw hundreds of human bodies suspended in some kind of clear solution with one tube going into their abdomen.  The tube had a florescent liquid flowing into each human\\'s stomach.  I was hor! rified.  The being told me, telepathically, not to worry.  These were just generic shells that they had created through genetic replication many years ago.  The human shells that they had were devoid of any soul or spirit that made us human, and had no awareness whatsoever.  The alien then told me not to be afraid once again, they have no intentions of harming any human being, only a fascination and a need to experiment.  The only time they deal with real live humans is in a controlled and friendly environment with no intent to harm or frighten.  All of the sudden, in my mind\\'s eye, I saw a small town just like any here on earth.  There were humans, happily living out their lives in a place that was created by these beings.  Almost like a scientific zoo, but the humans were blissfully unaware of their situation.  These were genetic reproductions of actual humans from earth that they created to learn everything about the human race.  Once again, the being reiterated that not a single human was harmed, and that these humans were farmed there strictly for research, and were able to live their lives to entirety without any intervention from these beings; these brings were merely there to observe, not interfere.  Once again, I was suddenly outside of their facilities, gazing on the horizon, admiring their two beautiful suns.  I awoke, once again, in my own bed, with that same feeling of awe and being blessed with what I was able to experience.  I was astonished to have what seemed like a \"follow up\" visit, like these beings are making sure to take it slow, not to overwhelm, not to frighten, just to make contact with real earthly beings and share some of their culture.  I believe that the biggest thing these beings were trying to show me is that they are real, they have been making contact with humans for thousands of years, and were proud of their experiments.  Kind of like a \"hey, we are here, and there is no reason to fear us, let us show you!\"  I have not had another experience since the second one, which occurred in 2010.  Nothing even close.  I am not afraid that it will happen again, and I hope I do experience it again.  To me, it is almost like seeing the benevolent face of god.  These are truly good and beautiful beings that are reaching out.  It has been a life changing experience, for the better.  I hope that my story helps others and that others have been able to visit these beings.',\n",
       "       'Bright white sphere Creswell, OR. For the past couple of days, I have been doing research on ufo sightings and abductions. I have never witnessed anything personally, but all the reports of sightings everywhere has had me intrigued. My husband, my two daughters and I went to Springfield today, and on our trip in, I was telling them what interesting things I had learned in my recent research.  Again, on our way home our conversation again led to the topic of my research. Jokingly, my daughter pointed out the window of our truck, and said she had spotted a ufo. I made a joke also, and then we agreed that we wouldn’t make any more jokes, and that if we really ever see one, we would be able to know if the other was truthful or not? No sooner had we said that,  a very bright white sphere appeared on the north side.  Not in the sky, but next to us, about 100 feet away. It was gone almost as soon as it had appeared.  My husband yelled out “What the hell was that?”   None of us had an answer. We were st! unned. We certainly had not expected to see anything at all, and certainly not so close or low! We agreed that we had all seen the same thing, but had no explanation of what it could have been other than what we had been talking about. It looked to be about the size of a basketball from our view. It also appeared to leave a trail, like it was moving very fast.  What we saw, was not like what I have been reading about. The experience was very eerie.  This event happened while traveling west on Lynx Hollow Road, about 3 miles up Lynx Hollow Road, which is about 7 miles south of the town of Creswell.  It happened at approximately 9:45 pm. It was dark outside, and the area is very much a country setting.',\n",
       "       'Five Triangular shaped spacecraft seen over Memorial Park @ 8:30 pm Labor Day 9/06/10. Driving through Memorial Park, coming home from my son\\'s house after Labor Day, I looked up to see a huge triangular shaped object with various colored lights underneath. It was stationary.  I said to myself, \"What is that?...It must be some kind of light for one of the playing fields out in the park...but where is the pole to hold it up?\"   There was no pole.  As I looked closer I said, \"That cannot be a UFO this close to downtown Houston!\"  I was within about 3 miles of downtown.  The craft was facing downtown, which is east of the park.  Actually, they were pointing east southeast.  I was about the length of a city block inside the 610 Loop on Memorial.  They should have been visible from Loop 610 as well. A few other cars drove by, but none seemed to look up or notice them at all!  I looked around to see if the other cars were weaving or pulling over or pointing out the window.  (And no, I do not drink alcohol. I was totally sober, no drugs, either.)   I saw airplanes casually flying above all five of these UFOs and they were commercial craft...on their way to Hobby Airport.  This is how I knew the UFOs were pretty low in the sky.  The one nearest me was gigantic.  It was big enough that if I extended my arm full length from my body and held the hand flat, it would not have covered the craft completely!  I was on Memorial Drive, and there are no shoulders, but there was an unused left-turn cut out, (unused because it was night time and that part of the park was closed).  I pulled in there, cut the engine, and got out my cell phone to take a photo.  I noticed there were four others above the one larger one, therefore they looked smaller, but they were the same type of craft.  They were all facing downtown Houston, and seemed to be in formation. I rolled down my window to take a photo, and when that was done, the big one was gone.  I felt quite dizzy. I looked through my windshield and the big one had moved laterally to my right.  I felt confused, and then said aloud, \"Oh, they do not want their picture taken.\" I sat there a minute, then I said, \"Well, there is nothing to be done here.\"  And I drove home. When I got home, I sat down and watched TV and then went to bed.  It was not until later the next day I called anyone to tell them what I had seen, though I posted it on FB asking if anyone else had seen five large UFOs over Memorial Park the night before.  No response. About a month or two later, I called my friend, ((female name deleted)), and told her what happened.  I commented that it was so odd that I just went home and didn\\'t tell anyone at first.  I never called the media or the police.  It just didn\\'t occur to me. Niara is an abductee herself, has written about this kind of thing for the Durango Examiner, and she offered to hyphotize me (over the phone) to see what we could find out...if there were more that I was not remembering. So we scheduled something, and she took me into a light trance. There was more that I had not remembered, of course.  I was sucked up out of the car  window and taken away for 28 days, and then returned to my car a few seconds later. (They can traverse/manipulate time, apparently.) I got to see what they looked like. I was taken to another planet. If you believe me and want to learn more, contact me. If you do not believe me, I could not care less.  My intent for reporting this is doing a public service.  I do NOT want any publicity, please. I will talk if you want to contact me.  I can answer more questions.',\n",

       "       'ADDITION FOLLOW-UP INFORMATION FOR JUNE 1, 1965  BLIDING LIGHT HOVERING ABOVE US   This is a follow-up report on me and my three cousin\\'s frightening and true ufo encounter on June 1, 1965 while living in the White Plains-Scottsville, Kentucky area as a young kid.  We still talk about this case among ourselves quite often, and have shockingly discovered some addition information we know is related to this UFO encounter.  It is unbelievable to say the least.  My only hope is that people will believe what I am about to tell you.  I am no liar or scam artist.  As earlier reported, the huge UFO hovered straight above our heads, and we were blinded by the bright yellow light which was shining down upon us.  We tried to look up but the light was blinding us, and the noise was deafning as well.  The large object made a hissing-swishing sound with a very loud roar to it.  Now, the new information I am disclosing to you is mysterious, and we are left to wonder what happened to us, and why.  We all now believe we were indeed abducted by the UFO, and! lost track of our time.  We also have the \"evidence\" to prove it.  A few short weeks or so after the UFO encounter we were all in our White Plains Elementary School one day having our classes as usual.  All of a sudden the principal sent out a loud message over the intercom telling us that \"all\" of us kids in the entire school (close to where the UFO-abduction took place) were going to be inoculated for some flu disease or something etc.  It was in the summetime?  We were to go class after class until everybody was done inthe entire school.  When my class time came my cousin R. was with me and we both went to the front of the school with our other clasmates in the middle isle, stood in line, and waited our turn.  The funny thing was that the doctors, or whoever they really were, hid their faces behind white masks and wore white uniforms and gloves.  I proceeded up to receive my shot and then it got really strange.  A person took out a large machine, like a huge staple gun, held it to my \"forehead,\" between my ey es and stamped me and said it was done.  It was a \"diamond\" imprint placed right between my eyes, and I still have the strange diamond imprint to this very day.  My cousin R. got a circle imprint placed between her eyes on her forehead just like I did, and hers is still there today too.  Why were we not given shots in the arm or buttocks like normal?  When I got home and told my father what had happened he said, \"What do you mean you got a mark put on your forehead?\"  I showed the diamond mark to him and he got very upset and angry.  Then after he contacted the school the next day he never mentioned it again, and I found this strange as well.  I told my current physician a couple of years ago about the incident, and she told me that shots were \"never\" given in the forehead, and when I showed it to her she was dumbfounded.  We all cannot find any information on getting shots in the forehead anywhere.  Why were we marked?  Why the diamond-circle s! hapes?  We do strongly now feel that these unusual shots-markings had something sinister to do with our neightborhood UFO encounter.  This additional material is \"ABSOLUTELY TRUE.\"  As stated earlier, we have the proof to prove it, especially R. and I.  I look at my mark today on my forehead &lt;&gt; turned the other way, and it baffles and concerns me.   Today, at times, I know I am beng watched, and have heard radio chatter outside my bedroom at night.  I hear strange \"clicks\" in my house occasionally too.  Sometimes I even fear for my safety because \"they\" know that I know the truth about UFOs and Extraterrestrials.  They are indeed real.  Who are we?  Why were we marked?  Lastly, what does these strange symbols on our foreheads mean for our future?  Are we being monitored for some strange reason or another?  I must remain ananymous about my identity because I feel I might be in danger.  My cousin R. feels the same way.  My story is true, and as a Christian I take my honesty and integrity very seriously. !

       "       \"This was in 1969 and I was only 16. There were eight of my family and friend that witnessed this event. My UFO sighting in 1969  It was a warm summers night in Princeton Pa. and I was visiting my girl at her house.  Unlike today communicating with your family could be a problem. You see back in those days we were lucky if we had land phones in our houses. Many of these phones were still the old party line phones too. So there could be a long wait at times to get to use your own home phone, unless of course you interrupted the conversation of those who were using it and asked them to allow you the use of the line. Fortunately for me such was not the case on this particular night.  My girl and I were at our favorite spot which was right beside her little record player in a room in her downstairs. We were listening to some of our favorite tunes on single 33 records. Those old record players were cool because you could load up a half dozen or so records and not have to change them every 3 minutes. It was the high tech of the day! At least for what we could afford.  As we listened to some songs the phone rang and I was told it was for me. When I took the call my Mother was on the other end and she was quite excited about something that was outside of our house. She asked me to get home as soon as I could to see this object which she claimed was floating above our farm. I told my girl friend about what Mom had said and we piled into my car to go see it.  She had a younger brother who wanted to go so we let him this time.  I had only been driving since Oct. of 1968. Which was about nine month's total. So it was always cool to get in my 57 Chevy and speed down the road. Today you can hardly get me to drive anywhere.  We were only 5 miles from my place so it took no time for us to make the trip. As we topped the last of several little hills on the way we could see an amber colored object in the sky hovering above Mom and the rest of my family. They were all standing in our driveway looking up at this thing. The object did not move the whole time we approached the house and parked the car.  When we got out of the car it was still hovering over the trees. It covered the house and the road and some trees across the road. It was huge, at least four times the size of our home and it was silent. It made no noise at all. The object was not like many UFO's that we had seen on T.V. reports. Most of those were blurry movie film and camera stills. This was crystal clear and it was amber in color. I say clear because we had no trouble making out that it was nothing like any of our aircraft. The only thing was that its color came from a light that was around the whole craft. We could see what appeared to be a disk shaped metal craft inside of the amber light. We could not see any markings on it or any windows or doors. It looked solid in the light and it was silent.  Well silent that is for most of the time. What this craft would do was hover over the trees and house for approximately five minutes. After that amount of time it would turn on some kind of device which sounded like a very large vacuum cleaner. The noise from the craft lasted only a minute or so and then it would stop. Every time the noise stopped the craft would shoot straight up until we could barely see it. It went so quickly that we could only see a streak of orange light trail behind it. It would stay up there a little while then it would shoot straight back down at us. It came down so fast we thought it would hit us. Lucky for us it always stopped at tree top level. It repeated these sounds and the up and down manuvers for approximately an hour. I do not know how many times but I will guess a dozen or more.  I am writing this event down one more time for my children and their children too have a record of. I believe it is worth remembering. I do not have any memory of an abduction of any of us that night. Even though the craft behaved strangely and returned so many times. If I believed that hypnotizing someone is actually possible I would be hypnotized just to remember the event better and hopefully find out if there were any abductioned.  We did try to contact the police but that was a joke. They laughed at us and said yea right then hung up the damn phone. Ever since this experience I have not trusted any policeman to help me out of any fix. Of course it was 1969 and people then were a lot less inclined to believe that there were any UFO's in our skies.  The little picture I linked to this post is eeriely reminiscent of that night. However, the light from the craft did not shine out from it like a flash light. It just enveloped the craft and barely light up the tree tops.  One more thing before I close, the book of Ezekiel speaks of a craft that the prophet saw in a vision. If you study hard you will see that Ezekiel's craft was a bright shiny amber colored object. (amber is the color of a highly polished brass/bronze metal)  I have wondered many times if our sighting was of the same craft!\",\n",

I sat down in the den to watch some tv when I heard and “felt” a hum in my ear. At first I thought it was the tv, so I messed with it, it was not. Then for no reason, I got up and opened the door that lead out to the back porch. As soon I opened the door, the hum got twice as loud. Once again for no reason I looked up just over the back roof of the house. For a split second I saw a bronze craft hovering just over the roof top. Its hard to explain what it looked like as I only saw it for a fraction of a second. I remember it being somewhat long in the front and had some type of tail. The next thing I remember was the feeling of waking up after being knocked out. It took me a few moments to get my bearings, when I remembered I had seen something over the roof. I then looked back up to see what it was and saw the tail end flying over the front of the house. My heart was racing. I ran around ! to the front of the house, but all I saw was a strange looking rolling cloud configuration dissipating up into the sky, and then it was gone. I went back into the house, it was not approximately 6pm.',\n",

We were out by Central Park just around sunset when suddenly a plethora of what sounded like explosions started sounding off.  I looked up to the sky in search of the source of this screeching sound and I saw a series of strange somethings.  They looked like odd lights that went upward towards the sky and then made the most godawful racket and then a shower of lights!  My friends and I retreated via the lift to our flats where we all most urgently had to use the loo out of stark terror!  We thought we were going to be abducted.

Trying to get control of the situation and cover it up, I assume! That no good government of ours! Villains trying to keep us in the dark about The Truth.  After a while the lights and bangs went away and we were able to relax again, unabducted and alive. I hope this recounting helps you in your Unidentified Flying Object Ology.\",\n",
       "       \"Possible abduction in Fountain Valley, California, intellegent life has arrived and wants us to know!  500 Lights On Object0: Yes On a overcast night off to the east where John Wayne airport from our back yard is; I saw a red light come from out of the clouds.  I had thought I had seen little sparks of light every once in a while, but thought i was just tired.  I didn't think about it at first; but as this red light was slowly proceeding towards the West, in my direction very slowly, just below the clouds, I realized the light was not flashing like a normal plane, nor was it making any sound. I saw a segment on Destination Truth where they dared to flash a light at what they thought was a UFO and it responded back.  So I was smoke a cig and thought I would try so I took 3 quick puffs then 3 slow puffs off my cig, and the light,responded. I was shocked, it was a UFO, so I called up to my son who was watching TV in his room with his window open, I said &quot;Shane get over here&quot; SEVERAL times to no avail, when I turned & looked at the object it was over in the direction of the police department which is maybe 1.5 miles north east of us, and saw the light make a couple flashes and then some sparkles came downward, the kind you see from a sparkler when a child just holds it. I wanted to get a picture; but have a disability and move very slowly so i SCREAMED &quot;SHANE GET YOUR CAMERA, GO TO THE WINDOWN&quot; but he didn't come so I went in the house to get my cell phone. When I came back it was gone.  It was no where. Not in the front, or other obstructed view areas. I have in the past had sightings; but for some reason this one really shook me up. maybe it was caught on a traffic light or business security camera?\",\n",

It was oval with lights around the outside of it, underneath.  Its size was about 30 feet in diameter. It was a metalic material.  It was silent,  No noise,  It was hovering and not moving.  It was so close I felt it could of been a possible abduction.  I went in the house and came back, instantly it was gone when I came back out.

I told her that I'd show her what I had contact with 4 years ago. Something in me told me that I had to take her home, so I did. After I get home, I sit in my backyard until my other friend and his two friends come over. He also had contact with these ships 4 years ago. I can't explain it but once he got there, I give it 15 minutes. We see a triangle craft flashing lights at us TO MY MUSIC that was playing on my phone! I was lost in thought! I was going to take a picture but It moved away from sight. We decided to go to the spot 5 minutes from my house to be in the middle of nowhere to check the skies. We park beside a field of corn stock and the ship comes. But it moves across the sky slow. We get into the car to get closer, but it begins to leave. I stop the driver and I get out. It appears in another location, MAYBE over t! he Mississippi river. It sat there and opened the bottom hatch and a BEAM OF LIGHT shots down to the ground below it!!!! It slowly moves after that and another ship appears on the opposite side and they are slowly moving towards one another. Then they stop and flash red lights at us... Like it was a warning of some sort. Distracting us the whole time, we did not notice that they dropped something and whatever it was, IT CAME CLOSE TO US! Me and one other HEARD THE GROWL like noise. I looked in the tall field of corn and on top of that there was a white orb being followed by a red one, on ground level! It was maybe two car lenghts away from us. We left because of the growl and There is more, but it's strange signs. I have a feeling I will see more tonight. I don't know what to do, and there isn't really anyone to speak to about it because NOBODY will believe anything like this. I'm not saying that I've been followed for years but every 4 years something has happened. 8 years! ago i was abducted. 4 years ago i had my first ufo sky event.! this ye ar, i got very close to something they released.

We then turned right trying to find a detour. I had just mentioned how good of time we were making bc i looked at the clock it was 8:00. We came upon a very dark wooded area in the road. My mom said wow that is really dark. That is the last thing either of us remember. Then next thing we knew we looked at the clock, it was 8:30. It literally felt like seconds before it was 8:00! My 21 month old daughter had been fussy right before the woods, but was now very quiet. The dogs had been panting but were now still and quiet. Everything was earily quiet! We felt very disoriented and realized we were miles from where we originally were and in the totally wrong direction. Based on my memory and my good sense of direction, and my mothers knowledge of the area it made no sense to be where we were.  I then noticed a burning bump in the! back of my head behind my right ear. My mother felt very numb and extremely disoriented. We both felt as though we had a sunburn, a hot, tight feeling on our faces. She then noticed a bump in her head in the SAME spot. They looked like fresh needle marks. We drove to my mothers house in Seaford in shock and disbelief of what just happened. Since being home we have experienced headaches, neck aches, and feeling shakey. However, the swelling behind the ear has gone down on both of us. I was unable to find a mark on my daughter. We are upstanding citizens and this is NOT a hoax! Something very strange happened to us tonight, something we will never forget. We are thankful we had each other to share our experience with bc it defies logic.',\n",
       "       \"UFO Sighting In Hartland Wisconsin Ocotber 26, 2012 As my mom and I were driving on our way home from the grocery store my mom suddenly slowed down the car and pointed up in the sky saying &quot;whats that&quot;?  When I first looked at it I thought it was the northern star because of how bright and big it was.  Then as I looked towards the right of the object I noticed a red pulsating light.  At first I thought it was just a plane going past, but then I realised that it wasnt moving.  My mom stopped the car and we just sat their in awe.  We were watching it for a good couple minutes and I decided to whip out my Ipod and film everything we were seeing. As the few minutes went by the bright light suddenly began to fade immensly. I screamed at my mom, &quot;The lights going away, its dimming&quot;!  And then it started to slowly move to the left. My mom and I began to follow it with our car.  All of a sudden it shot so fast behind a tree, that we had to speed up greatly to get in view of it again.  When it shot super f! ast it looked like a mdoern day deciption of a UFO. It was very slim and oval like. When we got in view of it again, on the other side of the tree, it was now giving off the very same bright light that it was giving off when we first saw it.  My mom decided to pull up in a little parking area and get closer to it. I on the other hand was freaking out.  I told her no. I was afraid of getting abducted because of all the stories I have read about things like that happening. But my mom was not scared, she was facinated and incomplete awe.  As we were wathching it she was telling me, &quot;I have never seen anything like it.&quot;  As we were sitting their, the UFO was going in all sorts of directions, kind of like it was scanning the are.  Then all of a sudden it stopped, and soon enough it started coming towards us. I was freaking out and telling my mom to &quot;Go, get out of here! Go!&quot;. I was literally crying tears of freight. But within a few minutes it began to turn around and slowly turn around and go the opposite direction. The white light began to immensly dim again but the red light was still pulsating through all of this. At one point when we were so close to it, it looked as thoughs omething was hanging down from it. My mom thinks that maybe it turned and as we could only see the red light, the white end light of it was hanging down as it turned. We really are not sure what it was hanging. While we were sitting their watching all of this occur, I remeber telling my mom a few times &quot;Look how big it is! it looks like a car&quot;.  And let me tell you it was huge! I also remember a hearing it when we were very close to it. As it was coming closer I began to hear it even louder. It sounded like the noise a helicopter gives out. But the thing was..it was NOT a helicpoter. As it was going the other direction, my mom backed out of the parking space we were in and began to follow it. It was moving at a farily steady pace at this point. As we were on the street of our house already, my mom stopped the car at the side of the road and we just sat their watching it. The bright light began to dimmer again, and the red light went away. As we sat their I remember there was one point in which the light was gone completely and we couldnt see it anymore. But then it lit up again. We watched it as it went higher and higher up into the sky. It sat in the same exact spot for the rest of the night until we went to bed. If any other person didn't see what we saw and just looked up in the sky at the moment, they would have thought it was a little star because thats what it looked like. A little dim flickering star up in the night sky. This experience will stay with my mom and I for the rest of our lives. I have always believed in UFO's..but my mom on the other hand, has not. She doesnt believe in UFO's, ET's, or even the paranoraml. She is a &quot;I'll believe it when I see it&quot; type person. And after tonight..she whole heartedly believes that wer are not alone in this universe. A few times throughout the video we shot, you can clearly hear us saying, &quot;Its just a helicopter&quot;, then &quot;No, its not&quot;. We were in denial and didnt know what the heck the thing was. It was def not a plane or a helicopter. There were planes flying throughout the sky while we were watching the UFO. They looked NOTHING alike. All in all, my mom and I know what we saw last night..and no one can take away that experience form us.\",\n",

My girlfriend and I were laying in the bed of my truck of the Grand Haven Beach parking lot, she was telling me about astronomy, space and time.

The next thing we know there were two of them in a line formation then they moved side by side and went their separate ways.   We then started to talk about abductions, and the next one we saw slowed down above my truck and lit up brighter than the moon as if it could hear my conversation.

       "       'a repeat and endless loop of an object downtown suny albany campus   While a friend of mine was washing his downtown suny albany campus dorm room window he witnessed the object and ran into my room and directed me to watch out his window.  At first I didn\\'t see anything and felt a wave of embarrassment while I look back at him to detect any foolish prank and as soon as I looked at him he redirected again to watch out the window.  His words were \"keep looking\".  So I turned back and a moment later the object recreated itself without any warning. a few second would pass and the object would vanish.  Then the whole affair would repeat without end.  A search for a camera return zero results, so without means to record or anyone to report we went out of the dorms and towards the object betting on a better view.   We followed the object until dawn and the morning light and walked back to home base. We never spoke of the events or bothered to look skyward again.  Were we abducted?  If we were \"they\" did a good job of it.  In the morning hours!  I remember seeing birds, that idea horrified the other witness.  He said \"It was not a flock of birds.\"   No sound and maybe an outlined with small lights.   Years later I heard of a field trip just to witness this thing.',\n",
       "       'I saw two rows of well lit windows suspended over the trees. I was riding in a pick-up truck on the passengers side.  I looked out of the side window and saw an object suspended just above the trees.  It was absolutely stationary. The only thing visible was the windows.  They were all equally lit.  The color of the light was uniform and identical to the color given off by an ordinary incandescent light bulb. There were two rows of windows, one row across on top of another(upper and lower, vertically in line) and approximately 18-20 across. All windows were the same size, about 6-8 feet high by 8-10 feet across.  The object was between 150 - 200 feet away. I stared at it intently without even blinking, expecting that I would see somebody come to one of the windows, if I didn\\'t take my eyes off of them.  At the same time I was watching, I was yelling at my friend, who was driving, to pull over.  I repeated myself very sternly to pull over 4-5 times.  He was preoccupied at that very same time searching the middle of the seat for! his tin of chewing tobacco with his right hand, while driving with his left hand and never took his eyes off of the road.So he didn\\'t see it.  I couldn\\'t tell him to look because we had just came off of a curve, before I saw what I saw and we were heading for another curve shortly.  Also, I think I was just so excited, that the only words that I could get out of my mouth was \"pull over\" repeatedly.  Has we approached the next curve the object became obscured by trees and a house for 2-3 seconds and then we pulled over after that.  The place where we pulled over was only about 2-3 seconds past the time that I lost visual contact and the area between where we stopped and where the object had been was totally clear, but it was not there any more.  Neither was there anything visible any where in the entire sky. My friend was very irate and asked me what the big emergency was which we needed to pull over for.  I told him what I saw and he just seemed perturbed about it and didn\\'t seem! like he believed me. The road is a road that I drive almost e! very day , about a mile and a half from my house.  What I saw was akin to seeing a well lit, 2 story, 125 foot long office building floating stationary over a familiar area of trees that would normally be clear of any lights.  It was a very clear, very crisp sighting of something very solid and real.  I\\'ve got to tell you also that I had an immediate thought that crossed my mind as soon as I could not see the object any more and that was, \"Could we have just been abducted even though it appears that we never left the vehicle, didn\\'t lose any time, didn\\'t pull over until the object couldn\\'t be seen, and it seems that I was very aware of what I saw before, during and after, exactly as I have explained it here.\"  What I saw sticks with me like glue and it seems to get under my skin more and more as time goes by.  The past few years I have searched the internet for pictures and diagrams of objects other people have seen, hoping to find out if anybody else saw the same thing at any time.  I came! across the sketch that Barney Hill made of the object that they saw.  It looked to me that it was the same thing that I saw, only looking at it from the side.

       "       'Orange/Yellow strange lights above saratoga springs / schuylerville ny I was outside my home smoking a cigarette last night when i noticed a orange/yellow (cant really describe the color which is odd..?) light moving over the wooded area about a half mile across the street from my home. at first I thought it was a plane as we do see them often, but than the object moved over towards my home about 500 yards south, now on the same side of the street above the treeline and in just a matter of what appeared to be instantaneously... regardless it was fast.  The light went off at some points and than on while it continued to move around the area of my house (within 3-4 miles as i was trying to watch it, the light was not always on). The reason i know for a fact this was no ordinary flying object to our knowledge of aircraft is for a few reasons. 1) the object circled and zig zaged over the hill in the back of our home at a speed that would be impossible for any pilot to handle. 2)  The object at one point was directly above my home about 600-700 yards (hard to say how high, but not high enough for an airplane in our area, but high enough not to hit any trees or anything by far.)   When it was overhead there were no blinking lights indicating it being an aircraft of ours... the only lights were a mix of yellow/orange (again i cant explain the color, almost as if nothing ive seen..).  Needless to say when it was that close to my home over the biggest tree in our yard, i ran back to the house to make sure i wasnt going to be the next person with an abduction story or something like that to be the town crazy....  Anyhow if anyone else saw this light/lights in the sky please report it on the web.  I could not have been the only one who saw this.  It was fast moving, and did not always have the lights on as if it were moving sometimes without lights..?  but there was something out there that is a fact.  Please post if you saw anything, i would like to reassu! re myself that this did occur and was not just some strange weather incident or anything over that nature...  THANKS&gt;',\n",

       "       'A group of aliens went into my house and implanted me with a blue sphere, at night. This is a personal account of a time when my home, which I am still a current resident, was broken into and I was implanted by a being who I can only describe as a grey reptilian, with something like a small blue marble shaped object. I am going to be as descriptive as I can be, but I do not remember everything and I only have a crude drawing to depict some of what had happened. I was laying down in bed, on a mattress on the carpeted floor. In my room there was a home gym, an entertainment center with a television and a DVD player. I witnessed very bright lights outside of my bedroom window, and when I got up to see what was going on, they were unlocking the back door, the sliding glass door, when I retreated to my bedroom and locked the door. I then heard voices speaking to my in English telling me to make it not be so much of a struggle and give up peacefully.  Also, the object knocked out the electricity to my house. A being that was tall, and slim, and had what appeared to be grey skin entered into my room accompanied by at least one who is very short, something like up to my thighs (I am six feet tall), I immediately felt as though I was tranquilized and fell back onto the bed. I awoke again when a being calling himself a doctor of sorts, although he said that he didn’t go to Harvard or anything like that, was preparing a device which looked like a pistol, but bare bones, just a frame, a long slender metallic object used for inserting and a blue object, which was a small sphere. It proceeded to insert the blue sphere into my left nostril and what seemed like up into my brain through my nasal cavity until I heard a drilling noise and a crunch.  I was sedated, but I felt compelled to get up, walk to my bathroom and to look at myself in the mirror.  I then noticed profuse bleeding from my nose, I then fell unconscious, backward, into some other being who said that he would catch me, although I must have been very heavy for him, as he struggled to catch my falling body.  I still am not clear on whether or not I fell on the rim of the bath tub, although I seem to recollect the noise of that happening. I was numb. When I woke up, it seemed to me to be very late the next day, but admittedly I do not remember what day it was when I was implanted. I actually went later to get a MRI image of my brain, because I had remembered it shortly after, and the doctor said that something was wrong, and people in suits proceeded to confiscate the images, I was told to leave the premises, and I was not charged for the MRI scans, but was not allowed to see them. But I would like to give it another go, I would gladly submit to MRI images or X-Ray scans, or polygraph tests to verify to you that I am honest about this, I believe that this object is still inside. The one who put this object into my head, he said that they wouldn’t be able to remove it, because that would kill me, but that there would be scar tissue around where it will heal. This is really only one of several interactions, I am a multiple abductee. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date above is approximate.  PD))',\n",

In tune, in what ever tune it was. it wasn't an ugly sound u know.  Just one that made  you know it was there.  Powerful.  It made me palse the TV.  And seriously wonder what it was. Also, I didn't mention, but still remember, how it blacked out the stars in the background.  It was black. I couldn't see a star but the the lights.  Not until it left from me a little ways. P.s.

It was night time and I could feel that sound, the I was lifted up off the ground suspended for a time. Then snatched backwards at an angle into the sky.  I awoke panicked.  So maybe it was a dream.

       "       \"This was a close encounter of a UFO.  This was around 11:53 PM and I was 12 and I was helping putting stuff in our U-Haul in our driveway and I felt this weird sensation to look up and I saw this ufo disk/ saucer and it was 7-10 feet above my driveway and it made no sound just hovered.  The UFO had 3 lights on red, white, and blue. The object was black and had a black tinted window.  It was really weird looking underneath. I'm starting to think there were line patterns underneath that almost resembeled circuit boards. The light  frame was  a bit bigger than a watermelon, but were ovaled shaped.  It was all black underneath, but it's hard to rember if there were other lights on which I think there were. This took place on Chase Oaks street. I think the line patterns were going from straight lines to curved lines and were connected to little bright lightbulbs. I'm uncertain how long it was there for at least a few minutes and I don't know if I was abducted or not! , but I think if I was I wouldn't have remembered so much detail from this encounter. I remember running inside to tell my dad and I went back out their by myself and a minute later it was gone. I didn't see it take off. It was in Chase Oaks off of Baird RD.

       "       'The craft hovered approx. 15 ft. above my station wagon. November 17, 1977 walked out my apartment with three daughters (13, 11, 6).  Oldest daughter directed me to orange object in the sky.  It looked like a Chinese orange lanterns.  We drove up I95 a short distance to see other daughter. On the way back down I95 (7:30 pm) same daughter directed me to look out her window, front passenger window, and we saw the orange thing again.  It appeared to follow us all the way up I95. As I turned into our apartment complex it began drizzling and same daughter pointed ahead at our apartment.  There above my apartment sat an object about 30 ft. above.  It looked like it had two high beams, but no light was cast forward, as in car headlights.  As it appeared to approach us, neither of us were afraid.  All of a sudden it was right in front of my windshield although we did not see it travel toward us.  It got to my car in about two seconds, although we did not see it advancing.  It had three lights on the bottom.  Now I can’t remember exactly which lights were where, but there were two same colored lights, one in the front and one in the back under the vehicle.  There was also a light in the center of it.  It was two red lights and one green, or two green and one red.  Don’t remember. She never ever showed an interest in UFOs.  She yelled at me to stop the car and I did.  She jumped out of the car and onto my hood.  I was hanging out the left door looking up.  Above me was a circular metal craft, with a definite top and bottom, but no seam to separate them.  It was the length of my station wagon. I looked for widows, a door, an opening, screws and anything to figure what held the top and the bottom together. As it passed my station wagon, it very slowly skimmed at about 3-4 miles an hour (guessing).  It rocked back and forth as it went over us.  It had a sound much like the fan in a bathroom. I got back in the car first yelling for my daughter to get back in the car, which she did.  When she shut her door she said, “Wow, Mom, did you see that thing take off?”  I said, No, I got back in the car before you.”  She told me it took off like a jet into the air and disappeared. Once home a friend told me to call the nearest base (name not given here).  I asked for the Officer In Charge and reported my sighting.  He thanked me and said he may get back to me. By now my daughter came out of the shower and asked me about marks on her stomach.  I had never known about Betty’s  Hill’s secret, so I couldn’t connect it.  My daughter had three fresh needle marks below her naval.  We could still see fresh blood.  She said she didn’t get her skin caught in her zipper. About four hours later the Officer in Charge called me back.  He confirmed that I had seen a UFO because it was now being sighted over another state (can’t remember which one), but it was at least four states to the west of us.  He asked me if I would talk to two agents on Sunday and I agreed. The two men came and told me they were from UFORIC.  I believed them.  I remember the oldest man’s full name and that he said he lived in New Jersey. The other man I only remember his first name and he said he lived in South Philadelphia. It took years for me to ask myself where they got the photographs of all those UFOs. They had two thick albums with them full of UFO pictures.  Some of the pictures were drawn by various people, but most of them were actual photographs.  We could not identify the UFO we saw but agreed it was the top of one of them and the bottom of another.  They asked us to separate and draw the UFO.   They were almost the same except my daughter had drawn some kind of antenna on hers.  I argued that there was none and one of the men said, she saw it on the opposite side, that’s why you didn’t see it.  I don’t remember if we told him about the needle marks because I had not yet connected them to the sighting.  Years later my daughter said to me, “I’m sorry Mom for telling you all this time that I remember the UFO, but I really don’t remember it at all.  She wanted to pretend she saw it because I saw it and one of my daughters in the back seat saw it. It was years later I learned of the one thing Betty Hill never told anyone, because when people told her they were abducted or saw a UFO, most didn’t mention any markings and that’s how she knew if it was true or not.  I was stunned to hear this. My daughter died on May27, 2004.  My daughters and I were with her as she drifted into a coma.  She said four last things.  I will only tell you the pertinent one.  She said “Tell mommy, the aliens did this to me.” Personally, I don’t think she meant her illness.  Now I am guessing as she was dying, memories were passing before her and she remembered our sighting.  I tried to find UFORIC and there was no such organization.  But I did find that name in Canada.  I believe these men were from the government. I had been plagued with situations for years.  They started about 1963 up until 1972.  I was scared to death of my bedroom door.  I knew there were some “things” at my bedside.  I always saw the door start to open, but never saw who entered.  Usually, there was one at the bottom of my bed, one at the top of my bed and one mid-center. My youngest daughter when she was about thirteen used to feel something dragging her off her bed.  She remembers clutching the shag rug, holding it tight, knowing “they” were trying to get her out the window.  She never saw “them” and doesn’t remember if they got her out the window or not. Thank you so much for this opportunity to tell the whole story.  I will furnish the men’s names, where I lived and my daughter’s name if you request them.',\n",

       "       'A very large object, looking like a 50s Sci Fi Saucer shape with very sharp, distinct shape, but looking like a fire over Military Base Normally I sleep very well, but my normally calm Labrador woke me and asked to go out at 11:59 on about August 1st, 2013.  It was a no breeze evening with stars in the night sky.  In the direction of Military Base Gagetown was a basketball size (bigger than a large setting sun) object.  It looked like a perfect, saucer shape -- large round bottom with a dome on the top - as one would see in a fifties Sci Fi film.  The lines were very crisp and defined.  But unlike the silver shapes in the films - this was as if it was a fire - - within the lines.  The fire like light was moving as it would within a fireplace - - but staying within the perfect lines of the object.  I would guess that it was several miles from where I saw it -- if it were over head it would be perhaps several football fields large.  There was absolutely no noise.  My dog was riveted looking towards the horizen where it hovered.  Finally - after twenty minutes it lowered towards the earth and then disappeared.  Normally with a fire - and I have seen a number in my life - there would be a connection between the horizon and the upper most part -- but it would be \"jagged\" shape.  In this case there was no connection between the object and the ground - there was an amount of black space beneath it till it went down.  I have seen balloons and lanterns - -this was not what this was as they are much smaller than this huge object.  I am not normally interested in this sort of phenomena - but could not take my eyes off of it - nor could the dog.  what was it?  I have no idea.  In college and with my family\\'s Hollywood, special effects back ground I would say it could have been a Laser, 3-D projection????  Something the military was doing with Lasers?  But why would they be doing this?  My background is a Ph.D. in psychology, advanced nine years of work at an institute and privately training in Carl Jung\\'s work - 40 years of formal meditation training and teaching formal meditation.  I have worked in Forensics, supervised psychiatrists - and feel I am a fairly good observer.  My mother, a skeptic on most things, claimed to have seen a large saucer in 1947 abouts - which was seen by half of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and in the Pittsburgh papers.  My grandfather\\'s close friend was Harry S. Truman, who on either side of my birth in July of 1952 had to assure the public that the UFOs over Washington were not something to be afraid of.  But I personally have not had interest in this - and when I had an opportunity in the early nineties to work with John Mack, M.D - and I did interview some of the contactee/abductees - - although I felt they had real, valid experiences - - I did not feel drawn to work with the phenomena as I was working with death and dying at the! time.  So this was a surprise - -and I kept saying to my dog - \"Well - it could not be a UFO - they are not golden, fire like this is - - - \" - - - It was only a few days later that I googled it and found that there are something called \"Plasma objects\" that I realized that might be what I saw.

       "       'As a teenager I saw a flying saucer do triangular patterns then disappear. It had lights and was spinning The incident occurred around 1980, I was living in Algonquin. I was lying in bed falling asleep, when I realized what I was staring at should not be.  I was looking south over an area that is now built up with houses and Spring Hill mall in West Dundee.  I did not see the craft, however I saw the lights and shape of the craft. It was a flying saucer with red green and blue lights.  The lights were spinning like in an Ed Wood film.  Classic flying saucer. I seemed to be dopey with sleep or?  When I realized what I was seeing after several minutes, I walked to my window to stare at it.  I did not get my mother , she would have whipped my butt for waking her.  After a few minutes, either the craft moved or a second then third appeared.  It was in the sky, then disappeared and reappeared directly below where it had been but much lower.  The distance was impossible to tell. I think it was the same craft, but there was no time delay. It was not like &quot;blink-blink&quot! ; it was here, then lower.  Then it moved again to the right[west] of where it had originally been, level with the first location but all 3 were equidistant from the other forming an even sided triangle. It sat in the original spot a long time, then down, then over for a few moments each. Then disappeared. I lost a few hours that night beforehand.  The timing was so precise, the distance as well. I then went to bed, and had a strange animal experience like in a book from 1985 that I read a bit of. I lied in my bed and saw 2 lights at the top and bottom of my dresser perfectly lined up and centered. The lights blinked in perfect unison. I was so scared I nearly shit my pants. When I worked up the courage to turn the light on, I found 2 lightning bugs. They flew off immediately and I thought nothing of it until I read many abductees have strange animal sightings. [insect in my case] I have never seen anything like what I witnessed outside of science fiction, I truly believe it ! was a UFO. I have thought of being hypnotized to investigate, ! but neve r have.

       "       'Thought of as a Dream for 20 Years, Recent Information Convinced me that Iv been Abducted by Aliens. It was APPROX September of 1994, I had just gotten off work and I got home and laid down in my bed, I was relaxing like I often did and I laid on my back,  Just then I began to notice that I could see stars through the ceiling and the black of the space also became visible through the ceiling.   Just about then I looked down at my feet and realized I was outside floating just above the apex of the 2 story roof and just below my feet I could see the porch light.  Just as I am thinking, \"What the Hell!\"   I see a shooting star that calms me and takes my mind off the reality of this all.  As this star gazed across the sky it looked like a big rectangle reading glass with three smaller round reading glasses inside it.  It had a tail and as it gazed across the light from the stars behind it would bend, following the contour of the reading glass they shined through.  As it gazed all the way tot he other side of the sky it began to move down Toward me!!  As it got close to me it flipped over and the very moment it flipped over I could not only see the color of the belly of the craft but it almost seemed like this paralyzing sound was coming from this belly.  The belly of the craft was very Round Orange Orb like a great big Orange and around the equator of it had Several Bright Red Orbs much smaller forming a ring around it.  It was so scary and it felt almost as if the Orange belly was where the sound was coming from. This sound was very rapid and high Mid high pitch.  It sounded almost like a flute like \"Doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle, doodle!!\"  But the strange and scary thing about this sound was the absolute milli second that this craft aimed the belly of it at me, this sound hit me like a beam!!  This sound beam his me, and grabbed me like, I can not explain but it paralyzed me and held me for the craft to get right over the top of me.  As it hovered over me the sound pulled me into it.  As I rose up into the belly of this craft I KNEW What ever was inside it I did not want to see.  I did have the clarity to think that I did want to know what was next but I knew that It would be scary as hell so I called out for Jesus Christ.  Now I did this out of Natural reflex because I was raised Christian at this time in my life I was very Anti-Christian and believed Jesus Christ was a total Lie so it was strange I called out to him.   It was almost like using his name in Vane but in a way I was so scared I was asking for help too. What happened was amazing,  The moment I yelled, \"Jesus Christ, Save me!\",  the craft Dissolved and I awoke in my bed Struggling very hard to gain control of my Body.  I literally felt like I had Ropes tied to my Elbows and my Knees pulling me back to sleep and that I was struggling very hard to overcome it.  My eyes where wide Open, I was wide Awake, But I literally felt Ropes tied to my elbows and Knees and eyelids Pulling me back to sleep and paralyzing my body back to sleep!!!  I was able to over come it and Over the next few months I noticed a circular Scar on my left palm.  Not a cut but a Scar much like a Burn.  It scared hell out of me because you know it made my Palm look like a pentagram.  So were talking a circle about the size of a coffee cup.  It was very strange because I never had a cut, It looked like I had put my palm on a pipe end and twisted it,  However like I said it never looked like a cut, If anything it would have been a Burn.  In fact you know if you Heat up a Pipe end and put it to my palm when it is red hot, it would burn a mark on my palm putting a circle around my palm print making it look like a pentagram.  The scar lasted about a few years and then vanished.  I went on and on in my mind to recall ever burning a scar into my palm and it just did not happen!!   So about 6 months after this event I was watching a Documentary on TV and a guy came up with an explanation for Alien Abduction he proposes that they are a result of sleep paralysis.  He says the Body falls asleep and the mind stays awake paralyzing the body completely.  This is so the body will not act out dreams!!  What really strike me was the renaissance paintings he showed of the Incubis they where little deamonds that would terrorise people in the night.  The Paintings from the renaissance paintings these little demonds where depicted holding onto Ropes which where tied to the Elbows and knees of the humans and these demonds would have a foot braced against the body pulling on these ropes. This freaking Shocked me that for hundreds of years other people felt the same exact thing like ropes tied to them pulling them asleep. I was convinced this was merely a dream!!  Till about twenty years later in 2012 I was watching the Debunking of David Icke and the guy talks of a experiment that took place involving over 400 test subjects they used some root from brazil which is a drug similar to LSD.  This drug was known to give similar effects and the test subjects experienced similar effects to the classic abduction.  Later this disturbed many of the subjects they needed psychological help over the next few months they tried many things and stumbled onto one that worked.  One called out the name, \"Jesus Christ!\"  By mistake or nature and they vanished instantly!!  He reported this and they started to perform tests.  They told one guy to call out to Christ, told another to call out to Buddha and so on.  But the ONLY one that causes the entities to vanish is the name Christ!!  In the end they end up telling everyone to use the name Christ and eve for \"Non believers\" the moment they say the word Christ the bad guys Vanish!!  This blew my mind because though I was not on drugs I had the exact same experience, Long before this research group and never having known about this research group.  To find that they even tried the names of other gods and only Christ worked was amazing!!  Then something else really started to make me wonder if this happened or if it was a dream.  My situation was that it felt like an out of body experience or a dream.  But I do not recall every going to sleep, the moment I realized I was looking at stars a situation with a UFO which I assumed is a dream took only a minute or two and then I woke up some 12 hours later.  So in that I have experienced missing time,  And sure enough I have a very strange mark on my hand as well. Now come to find out I have common grounds with this test subject that took place.. Then another situation really startled the hell out of me.  A story I heard back in 1994 just after it happened and it was quite amazing but at the time I did not believe in UFOs so I assumed it was a Hoax.  But it was a case in South Africa where 62 Grade school kids saw two Silver Flying saucers during recess.  They also saw beings that spoke to them with ESP and delivered a Message.. Well, I had not seen that since 1994 since I was a teen ager and I had forgotten it and in my mind had written it off as a hoax.  However with a fresh mind I had stumbled onto the report again on youtube,  But now with all the UFOlogy and Ancient Cultural and pyramid technology research under my belt I can listen to each detail with a keen ear!!  Right away I noticed this was an Amazing situation and could not possibly be a Hoax.  This Child Psychologist interviews these school kids and he knows what he is doing,  He is very careful NOT to lead them in his line of questioning.  I loved the brilliant way he questioned them because It left a lot of credibility with me. For example he could have explained to the kids what ESP was and ask them if the Aliens talked to them with ESP.  But he did something that resulted in some solid data reporting because what he did was be so careful NOT to lead at all and allow the children to do the best job they can at explaining there Experience. He asked exactly how the man talked to them and the one kid said &quot;He said it to me with his Eyes&quot; WOW.. Anyway so realizing this was a very REAL Event.  It came to a girl that really frightened me with the reality in her eyes.  You can see the pure fear in her eyes and you KNOW this was real. But this girl says something that is really related to my experience.  Consider this,,  She is asked, \"What is the most scary part of your experience?\",  and she says, \"Sound that came from the craft, sounded like a Flute.\"  Now this girl sees two flying saucers with Freaking Aliens come out to abduct them and the most scary thing is the sound of a flute?  Well, the most scary part of My experience was the sound that came from the craft, sounded like a flute!!  Why?  Because that sound grabbed me and paralyzed me. Now the other strange Part.  The 62 school children Saw this experience in September of 1994!! So in September of 1994 BOTH my self and this girl from Africa see a UFO rather dream or real, we both see the similar experience!  Both my self and this girl Agree the most frightening part of the UFO Experience was \"The sound like a flute coming from the craft.\"   The event changed my life.  Because I went almost 20 years thinking it was just a dream but about 2 years ago when I saw this Debunking of David Ike and saw that others had screamed Christ to have these vanish, and when I realized the similarities that my experience has with the girl in South Africa.  And then I realize it was the Same Month and Year as My experience.. At which point it was hard to believe that it was not somewhat of a real experience..  So my recent travels to Yucatan travels I got really into researching UFOlogy, I learned to read Ancient Mayan Hieroglyphs, I am pretty much the third degree on Ruins on Mars, I talk with Wayne Herstel regularly.  I\\'ve reviewed all of Richard Hoagland\\'s work.  I\\'m more than convinced that Humans have a very long history on Mars long before Earth. And I believe this somewhat inspired me. But it did not inspire me till after I learned about the other event in Africa with the 62 school children and the Debunking of David Ike. That blew my mind and changed my life. Today I realize that I have a history of out of body experience style dreams, dating back to when I was a very young child so it is very hard for me to feel like it was not a dream, because it had that dream feeling. But I cant help but think of the Facts and NOW That I have gotten so deeply Involved in the current study of Ufology. I have come to realize the most current information is these Aliens are interdimensional beings and that is yet another amazing coincidence is that might possibly explain why the DREAM Abductions perhaps they are Abductions occuring to your soul!!  Or perhaps it was Real, I mean I did experience 12 Hours in about 4 Minutes and I did wake up with Scar on my hand that lasted few years, and I did have the similarities with the Research group and the 62 school children case.. So it is extremely dificult to know if it was real. It sure felt real as shit to me when my antichrist satin rock band ass was sreaming for Jesus Christ to help me!!  I heard you on C2Cam tonight and decided to tell my story.  I do not like to tell people because people have said some rude shit about it but it is possibly that you might know of some other reports so I figured Id tell every possibly detail just incase it matched with any other case..:)  Thank you very much!!

       "       'I think i was abducted when i was 11 years old in another incident. A moving star flashed a giant camera looking flash.  The flash lasted about 3 seconds.    When i was 11, a disc shaped object with lights evenly spaced lights on the side slowly right above me.  It had to be 200 to 300 feet above me and just hovered over me.

       "       'Orbs of light watching me it all started that night around dusk.  I looked up to see two jet airliners heading northeast. as the first jet got closer I noticed a ball of light coming out of the northern sky.  It looked like It was going to hit the plane but it was only 1000 to 2000 feet up and the plane was 20000 feet up.  I could not believe the pilot did not see it and then banked left to avoid.  The plane following  made a slight turn left all the planes that night made same turn to avoid this spot.  a couple hours later I watched five balls of white light playing in eastern sky and for some reason I sensed they knew I was watching them.  the five of them hid in a star formation cassipeia ?  I knew they were there but they did not move. I never took my eyes off of them. a half hour has gone by still no movement.  then I notice dim light 150 feet away from me on ground.  I went over to see it closer. it was 5 lights very dim shining on ground on  the same spot they were over lapping one ano! ther. I was still watching them and they were watching me. I went back to where I was sitting. another 30 to 45 minutes went by still no movement. I had to go in the house but did not want to leave. so I called there bluff. I went to where the lights were shinning on ground looked up at them and said I must be seeing things? so I shrugged my shoulders and headed toward house. the whole time watching them while I walked away from them. when I got to my door out of there sight all five of them moved off there spots and headed in a southeast direction. I yelled at them as they drifted off I knew you were there! this is only one of very many sightings I see most happen first week of august to the third week. I also have abduction story in Alaska. and many in house abduction were at night they come take blood and put things in me or take things out of me.  I would like to go to hospital but I get this feeling I would be betraying them I feel they have helped me. and they really like my A negative blood every 3 months more needle marks appea! r. well I will end this here. good bye and may alien be with you!',\n",

Even tho, in past instances I have seen evidence of other encounters.   Anyway,  I had just laid down to sleep after watching tv on my computer.  I was in bed and I was awake when I saw a bright red light come through my window which faces the east on the first floor of my home.  It was an intense red light which I have never seen before.  It shone through my blinds into the room about 5 or six feet on the ceiling and walls.  I had a feeling that I should be asleep and then they were gone.  I have two one story homes behind mine and a two story so it would have had to been close to the ground.

       "       'bright light, fireball, and triangular craft, lasted a few hours I reported a \"fireball\" UFO this summer, after a friend told me about your organization.  I checked back a few days ago and was excited to see another person reported the same object, at the same time, in the same area!  What a relief!  I\\'m not paranoid after all!  This is actually the second time I have seen a UFO. I have been checking out your website and the reports within.  I don\\'t know if it is of any use to you, but I saw a UFO when I was a senior in high school..way back when; and would have reported it then, if I knew of this forum.  I had a hard time getting people to believe what I had seen when it happened.  No one had ever heard of triangular UFO\\'s and glowing fireballs at the time.  However, I see they are common now. Let me start off by giving a little disclaimer.  I have always been fascinated by the idea of UFO\\'s and aliens, or actually anything paranormal.  I loved that show the X-Files and wrote a research paper on alien abduction when I was in eighth grade, but that is pretty much the extent of my involvement in anything like this.  I\\'m not fanatical, I just think it is interesting and entertaining. I think this report may be of help to you, because there are not many reports like mine from this time period, and as you will see; I witnessed a glowing ball and a craft.  Also, I have not been able to find a report where the shape of the object reported matches mine.  There probably is one, but I don\\'t have time to research UFO\\'s all day,  I\\'m a busy mom!   This happened in the early spring of 1998.  I just remember it was starting to warm up outside, but the fields hadn\\'t been planted yet.  I was driving home from Toledo with two of my girlfriends.   We were headed west on Airport hwy. between Springfield township and Swanton, we were approximately one mile past Toledo Express Airport when I saw a bright light, similar to that of a helicopter out of the corner of my left eye (south).  The light shone bright and then faded into the size of a radio tower light.  I asked my friends if they, too, had seen it, and indeed, they had.  Apparently, I was the only one impressed enough to mention it.   Just then it lit up brightly and faded again.  At this point we all knew it was something strange, and decided to check it out. As we began to follow this light, it began to get stranger and stranger.  It was now changing shape continuously, and also began to change color.  It was changing from large to small and white to red and orange.  The object did not appear to be moving at all, but it was hard to tell because we were in a moving vehicle.  We turned left onto a country road, not sure witch one, because many of them intersect Airport Hwy, and also because I can\\'t remember.  I believe it was somewhere between Swanton and Delta.  This would be around ten miles from where we originally saw the light.  I think this because the town we ended up outside of when we eventually stopped and pulled over would be located between these two towns further south on a map. We kept following this light after we turned.  It would almost disappear at times and then suddenly reappear even brighter than before.  The light got brighter as we got closer to it, until finally we were right beside it, about thirty miles from where we first saw it.  We were now out in the country and farm land of Henry county, about five miles north of Liberty Center, OH. Once we came within a mile of the light, it was no longer a light but a solid form aircraft.  We could only see it from the bottom and it was an equilateral triangle(as I remember, but it could have been isosceles), with a bright, round, white light in each corner.  I pulled off the to the side of the road on the left side.  We were out in the middle of the country and no other cars were out there. I got out of my car and could now see the entire craft.  It was hovering motionless and silent over the field.  Is was hard to tell how far away or up in the sky it was because it was so large, and it was nighttime. I could no longer see the bottom of it just the side.  The side was an acute triangle.  Again, the bottom and top were not visible at the same time.  The craft was covered in thousands of tiny white lights, all in lines, with one single red light right at the top point of the triangle.  In my mind I thought this must be where whoever is flying this thing is at.  If I had to guesstimate I would say it was the size of five or six football fields, just based on the number of lights on it, and maybe a mile up in the sky. My friends were totally freaked out and would not get out of the car, so they never got to see the craft like I did.  I had a camera in my backpack, and asked my friend to hand it to me, but she couldn\\'t find it.   My friends were begging me to get in the car.  They were completely terrified, and thought they were going to get abducted by aliens (we were teenagers).I thought this has to be some sort of experimental aircraft.  There is an Airforce Reserve base in Toledo.  I had never heard of anything like this craft before, and the closest thing I had ever seen to compare it to was a Stealth. I got back in the car at my friends urging, and we drove off.  The craft now began to appear as a light again.  We turned around to head home, down another country road.  The light was now shining more orange and more larger than ever.  We saw a truck with some young guys pulled over on the side of the road and thought they must have seen it too.  We stopped to ask them, but they were just sitting there, drinking beer.  We pointed the light out to them and they didn\\'t seem too impressed, but mentioned that they lived out here and had seen some strange looking lights on different occasions. We got back in the car and headed home again.  We were headed west again, and now it appeared as if the light was following us.  My friends got really scared and started to scare me.  My adrenaline was pumping and I was driving about ninety miles an hour because my friends were screaming and claiming the light was trying to get us.  I don\\'t know how much of that is true, I didn\\'t look back at this point because I was driving really fast and had to pay attention to the road. When we arrived in our town, Archbold about twenty miles from where the craft was we could still see the light, but it was only showing white, and I could tell it hadn\\'t moved position at all.  We went to the gas station, to fuel up, and I could see the light from there.  At this point I was able to find my camera, and took a few pictures.  Unfortunately when they were developed they were all black and blank.  We saw some kids out playing basketball, it was now about 11:00 at night.  We asked them if they had seen anything , but they just thought we were pranking them. When we arrived at my friend\\'s house, I decided to contact the authorities. This was before everyone had cell phones.  I called the Henry county sheriff\\'s office,(Archbold is in Fulton County), and told the dispatcher what we had seen, that it was still out there, that this isn\\'t a prank, and that everyone is really scared.  She told me that she was going to send a deputy to check it out, that nobody had reported anything that night, but not to be embarrassed because they do get a calls like this every so often. I got home around midnight and woke my mom up to tell her what had happened.  She thought I was just being crazy and told me to go to bed.  I also remember getting in a lot of trouble from my dad for driving the car so fast.  This was on a Friday or Saturday, and I remember drawing a picture of what I had seen and showing it to the Biology and Chemistry teachers at my school on Monday. I don\\'t remember what they said, I just remember they didn\\'t really seem to care at all.  My friends and I never really talked too much about the events of that night afterwards.  Why, I don\\'t know, but they always made me feel isolated about it, because I wasn\\'t afraid to talk about it, and I think they were.  We had a falling out a few years after high school (over a guy, of course), and I haven\\'t seen them since. As the years passed, I began to think none of this had really even happened, and I had just let my imagination get the best of me.  Then,in 2005 or 2006, one night when I was watching random TV, there was a rerun on one of the cable channels about UFOs seen in  the Midwest in 2000 that were triangular shaped.  I\\'m sure you know what I am talking about.  It was totally legit and hosted by Peter Jennings,  or one of those \"real\" news anchor guys.  I felt so validated! I don\\'t know what this object was, but it made such an impact on my mind I still remember all these details 15 years later!  I suppose it could be of this earth, the only thing that makes no sense is how it can emit such a bright, glowing, ball of light around it.  How can it be a light from far away, but a  dark craft up close?  I have read reports of either/or but not both together. I would be grateful if NUFORC could direct me to some. My personal theory, and trust me I\\'m no scientist, although I did have to take some Chemistry and Biology for nursing school, is that the glowing ball of light is actually some sort of exhaust from the craft that contains highly reflective particles, and it is reflecting it\\'s own light from all those tiny lights on the ship. Either this, or the craft is made of material that is reflective from far away but not up close. Just like airplane exhaust can reflect the sun and make streaks in the sky, only different.  Or when a fog is rolling in, and you can see it from far away, but when you are standing in it, it doesn\\'t seem foggy at all.  This would explain why we visually saw it as a ball of light from far away, but a craft up close.  I was actually standing in the exhaust so I couldn\\'t see the light reflecting it. This is all I can come up with, because if the craft was emitting so much heat or light that it could be seen from 20 miles away, being that close to it would have blinded my eyes or burned my skin.  I don\\'t know if anyone else has theorized this, but would be very interested to know if they have. Thank you for your time, I know this is a long and detailed report, It\\'s just been so long ago I don\\'t know what to leave in and out.  I hope this is helpful to your cause.',\n",
       "       \"Strange lights in the sky that move and follow me, and weird experiences. This is (possible abductions story and) UFO sightings. My background: I was born in Phoenix Arizona, went to a performing arts high school.  I did well there and graduated.  My family moved to Huntington Station, NY. Now we live in Huntington, NY.  I still live with my parents and I’m 21 going to college. I’ve lost track but I have been seeing weird lights in the sky at night (not every night) that move on their own will, and sometimes to my will, which sometimes flash with a sort of personality or speaking manner for a year and a half to two years now since after these experiences:  I thought I might have been in danger because I couldn’t sleep for three days in a row because I was shaking or my bed shook every time I was about to fall asleep and so I then went to the hospital.  The doctor told me I was hallucinating.  I sought psychiatric help and was put on anti-psychotics because they thought I had shizo-affective disorder.  I’ve been on medications for over a year and a half now and none of the medications I was put on or am on now helped in any way so that helps prove that I wasn’t hallucinating.  I have no family history of schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder although I do have a family history of paranormal activity.  None of which were thought to be with aliens (tha! t I know of,) but a few times when I was younger I realized that I had scars on my skin that seemed to have been a healing from cut (which they mysteriously disappeared later on.) I even showed my mother them and I had no explanation for where they came from or how it happened. On this one day I was listening to my first iPod touch on shuffle.  The songs would very often come up relevant to what I was doing or thinking at that moment.  The same songs even began to play over and over again which is odd for a 1,500 song playlist (the device was not on repeat mode.)  Later at night I came home and started looking up the lyrics to the songs I was listening to at that moment because I thought I was being communicated to from a higher being.  After hours of listening and reading it seemed the lyrics were being changed on the websites.  I eventually felt changes and weird sensations going on in my head, and after about 6-10 hours of this, with occasional breaks, I was dyslexic and felt an emotional void of darkness (I was not on - or had been on - any drugs.)  Sometimes between the songs I would hear a weird clicking sound or noises that didn’t happen before.  In the morning I went downstairs and then threw up in the trash can because of how sick it made me.  The next song had written in the lyrics, “Wow really you threw up?”  A song or two later it told me to kill myself in which I was about to but didn’t.  I later looked up the same lyrics and none of the edits were there.  Just to clarify I didn’t have that episode of insomnia until maybe a month after this. Later that week I was up in my room when it sounded like cabinets downstairs were opening and closing. As I was going down the stairs it stopped.  Another day that week I was lying down and I heard this strange hovering-like sound. It sounded like it was right above my house.  On a different day I was in my room looking outside the window hoping to see this light I thought might be a UFO.  I saw it and then got bored.  Later I was not looking at my window and my room lit up with this passing green light.  After I went to the hospital I was sent to an inpatient hospital to be watched.  During the middle of my stay there I was looking out the window to see if the UFO was there.  It was and the whole time I was watching it it was getting closer and until it was just about to go over my head to where I couldn’t see it it kind of sparkled a whole bunch on the bottom of the craft with orange lights.  By that time I was hearing a cute girly voice that said, “what was that?” just as it flew! over my head displaying the lights. For a while after the “mind screw” I was very sensitive to sounds and my jaw started moving on its own in ways I’m incapable of doing (before I was on medications so it wasn’t a side-effect from them.)  Eventually the noises stopped, in which the noises where from my surroundings like tapping on the car window or tapping on my ceiling or crackling of which were in synchronicity with my thoughts, and I started to hear this voice which developed from what I thought it was.  I still hear the voice and there was no difference of it being on the medications since.  The voice definitely has a conscience of its own because it says words that I have never heard in my life or at least words that I might not have heard since I can remember.  I hear this voice most of the day shortly after waking up to when I go to bed.  Now the voice is loving and reassuring.  It started happening again lately that I sometimes shake when I’m about to fall asleep but now I eventually am able to fall asleep and I can still feel my bed moving sometimes (just in a more evasive fashion.)   Just to point out my friend saw the moving light in the sky once and acknowledged my claim.  I’ve been told it’s just a satellite but I can’t agree because sometimes I see more than one at a time and it’s too often.  Usually they’re orange and about the same size as a star, but stars don’t flicker rapidly, change color, and move. Almost done… I see these strange a light in my room (when the lights have been turned off which is usually blue or white) or lights in the “forestry” behind my house sometimes at night which are yellow or red and may move as if in a swiping manner, and sometimes I see white lights when I close my eyes which are like sparks that linger and then sort of “shut.” Although I see lights behind my eyelids it doesn’t mean I don’t see them externally as well. Seeing them behind my eyelids are only recent and they don’t move unlike the ones I think are UFOs or whatever it is that’s in the “forestry.” The last note is that I have seen a large black eyeball on the ceiling of my room in the last house for a split second after I had shut my eyes for a brief moment. It then vanished.  All of this is experience. I knew nothing of extraterrestrials/extra-dimensional beings before any of this happened to me but only of the sci-fi stuff you see on television. None of what I have experienced is from those shows or movies of which I have seen. I did do research afterwards and found some common traits people shared with alien contact. There are many songs I have now found that share some similarities to my experiences and makes me believe in them even more. I should mention that my dogs would hide and be frightened at times, whining and barking at things when there wasn't anything going on, not even a storm or noises that we could hear. I apologize if this is a waste of your time..\",\n",
       "       \"Brilliant flash of blueish/white light that illuminated the entire area I was fishing, sitting back in my chair, changing the song on my iPhone when suddenly a brilliant blueish/white explosion of light illuminated the entire area. I look up just quick enough to catch a glance of what is very hard to describe with certainty because it happened so fast, but what I can say for fact is that whatever caused this flash was very close to me; about 20 yards in front of me and about 50 yards above the water. Literally almost over head. What I recall once I looked at the source was a blueish/white light with a bit of a tail, sort of like a spade, but the tail wasn't as acute. Also, the spade of light was slightly split in the middle by a blue streak. This light source/spade was about 20 yards wide and 30 yards long.  I imagine this phenomenon was a craft exploding into acceleration and what I saw was the propulsion like that from a modern rocket ship. Except this was light not fire. And it made no noise at all, that's the most unbelievable part to me, being as close as I was.  I don't believe I was abducted because there was no loss of time or bodily marks and such. Not even feelings of fear or unease. Although this was my first of three verified sightings/encounters in a month. This flash, & 2 separate orange circle/orb sightings that can be nothing other than extra terrestrial. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness elects to remain totally anonymous; provides no contact information.

       "       \"I and a friend first saw 2 UFOs at her house, and when I got home a few minutes later I saw the same two, and then eventually 7. Long Duration UFO Sightings:  On June 24, 2013, I was at my friend “Carol’s” house on Sanibel Island – a barrier island just off the coast of Ft. Myers Florida, USA.   Her house is on Clam Bayou, toward the northern half of the island, and is about a half of a mile from the Gulf of Mexico.   What I herein describe is based on notes I had written up the next day after this initial sighting, and several days following, in addition to what “Carol” and a MUFON friend later told me what I was  describing to them, “blow by blow,” on the telephone for a total of just over 2 hours   At approximately 10:15 p.m., we were on the second floor balcony, which faces west and is about 20 feet above the ground and about 25 feet above sea level.  Our eye level was just under 26 feet above sea level.  We saw toward the west an amber light just “blink on.”  Then about 2 minutes later, another amber light came on to the right/north of the first one (see drawing).  These lights were about the size of a finger nail at arm's length, and they were about two fingers held together apart – they were horizontal to each other.  We could not make out any type of a craft, only the lights.  The lights were “solid,” which is to say that they were not like turn signal lights on a car. The sky was heavily overcast and there was no moonlight.  It rained late that afternoon, but there was no drizzle when this was happening. We watched the two lights drift together very slowly toward the north for 10 to 15 minutes at the most.  By approximately 10:25, they had drifted behind some trees in the bayou.  The trees are about 50 feet high at the most.  The lights were just below treetop level.  Carol and I both guess that the lights were no more than a few hundred feet above the water. Shortly after we lost sight of the lights I drove exactly 2 miles (8 minutes) to where I live on Blind Pass, Captiva Island.  From a deck on the water behind my house I saw the same two lights again, just over the top of the railing on the south side of the bridge that connects the two islands.  My eye level on the deck is about 11 feet above sea level.  From my vantage point I estimate that the lights were two to no more than 500 hundred above the water; carol and I figured the same thing from her house. Based on my second initial sighting over the south end of the bridge, I triangulated where the lights initially were using Google Earth.  The lights were 1.53 miles away from Carol’s house,. 2.16 miles from my house, and 1.03 miles out from the beach.  I can send “need to know” people my Google Map drawings provide they agree in writing not to disclose where I and “carol” live. I called Carol shortly after I got home at 10: 41 to tell her what I was seeing, and stayed on the phone with her nonstop for an hour and 21 minutes.  I could not remember very well the next day exactly what I was telling her for such a long time; my memory is pretty poor to begin with, and the high anxiety I was experiencing likely compounded the problem.  In addition to that, I’m an early, early bird, and am usually asleep by 9 or 9:30, which may have affected my memory too.  Nonetheless, I saw what I saw and  Carol filled me in a lot on what I herein describe.  Unfortunately, carol, at 71 years of age, doesn’t have the best of memories either. I watched what appeared to be the same two amber lights for a while before a third light, of the same color and intensity appeared to the right of the first two.  They remained pretty much stationary but individual ones seemed to change a bit in intensity.  After another while they started drifting slowly to the north (to my right, and also drifted a bit higher in the sky.  Then a forth, same-type light came on.  When the lights came on they came they did not just “switch” on, but came on more like turning on a light with a dimmer switch.  These lights were horizontal to each other, but I seem to remember that they were not in a perfectly straight line.  The lights continued to drift slowly to the north, but did seem to become a bit dimmer, so maybe they were moving further away from me and more drifted more to the northwest and out to sea. After quite some time watching them from the deck on the water behind my house, I walked about 200 yards directly west of me to the beach.  I immediately saw the ones I’d seen on the bayside.  They were definitely very, very slowly drifting from the south of me to northwest (my left to right) and then just hung there for pretty much the rest of the time, about 20 to 25 degrees above the horizon.  I’d guess that they were no more than 3 or four miles away from me. Then another two lights of the same color and intensity came on to the right of the existing ones, for a total of six.  I had a 6-volt flashlight with me and I started flashing them, and I clearly remember Carol yelling at me on the phone (and she remembers this clearly too) not to do that -  and she was very, very frightened for me.  Whether it was me flashing my light on and off or not, the lights DID go on and off, one or two at a time. Then I started flashing an “SOS” at them – three long, three short, three long.  Although I did not get the same SOS back, the lights continued to go on and off.  Then a 7th one &quot;came on&quot; just a tad, maybe a finger-width at arms length, above the six, toward the middle, and it was a solid white but not overly bright, and just a tad brighter than the others, about the size of your thumb nail at arms length.  I then remember getting VERY frightened and started shaking and told Carol I was going back home, which I did, even though the lights were still there, hanging to the SSW off of where I was. When I left the beach the lights were still all together in a &quot;group,&quot; in a fairly straight line that was as wide as the fingertips on your d held just a tiny bit apart. It was overcast with no wind, and I never heard a sound from them.   At the time I remember thinking that they could not have been all that far way, and as I stated before, my initial sighting of them when I first got home from Carol’s my triangulation showed that they were just over two miles away. During this time the grouping of the lights would change, but not a lot - I could never make out an actual craft, and don’t ask me why I never took a photo with my phone, or got my camera at home. When I got back home I could not see the lights over the bridge, so they had indeed drifted northward during this time.  Despite Carol telling me not to go back to the beach, the scientist in me just had to take one more look, as this was what I thought was a once in a lifetime opportunity. I remember clearly that when I got back to the beach the lights were still there and in about the same place, but I swear on my mom’s grave that I saw a “being” standing on, or floating a tad above, the boulders that comprised the north jetty at Blind Pass.  The rocks were about 200 yards to the north of me and the figure was about ¼ of the way in from the end (see photos).  As best I can remember the figure was very tall – maybe 10 to 12 feet, and it was grayish, according to my very clear memory of it.  What is odd in my recollection of it, is that as a silhouette in front of an overcast sky that was light enough to easily see and differentiate between the Gulf, the rocks sky, it should have been black.  There was a definite head, kinda square-cut shoulders, and recalling it as I now write, it seems that it was wearing some kind of a robe, because of both the wideness of the figure from the shoulders going down to the rocks, and because I could not make out any legs, even ! thought I seem to have thought there should have been. This is where I really have no recall of exactly what happened next – it was just pass midnight, the latest I’d stayed up in probably 8 months due to back surgery and pain meds I have to take.  Carol told me the following day that I had described the figure to her (and that it was really, really scaring her), and that I had flashed my flashlight at it while telling here that “they were benevolent and that there was nothing to worry about.”  Just how in the world I ever came up with that is totally beyond me, because in my known-to-others belief, any aliens who are kidnapping and abusing us humans can’t be all that benevolent as many claim.  She then said that I said that I thought the figure was coming toward me, that I got really scared and hid in some bushes, and that I got lost somehow until I figured out where I was.  I was on the phone with her all the while (thank God), so I doubt I got abducted. I do remember telling her (which she corroborated) that I had finally had had enough of what I was seeing and that I was going home to lock my doors and turn all my lights on, which I did.  Again, from my bayside vantage point I did not see any of the lights when I got home.  I hung up talking to carol at 12:13 a.m. according to my phone log. For whatever reason, I went back outside behind my house on Blind pass at around 12:55 a.m., and saw the lights over top of the bridge again.  This time I called my MUFON friend “Tom” and woke him up to tell him that “honest to God Tom,” I am right now looking straight at some UFO’s.  Tom later told me that I was describing to him for 43 minutes pretty much what I had told Carol I was seeing – that I was going from the bayside to the beach and was flashing my flash light at the lights and that they seemed to be responding, and that I had again seen the bright white light come on for a while just above the amber lights.  Tom also said that toward the end I told him I was looking at the tall being on top of the jetty, and left the beach to come home just after that,  He said I sounded really frightened all the while I was talking to him. Finally, I have to be perfectly honest and say that I had taken some extra pain medication that evening/night to deal with my back problems, and that they may very will have affected what I was saying on the phone to my friends, as my friend Tom suggested to me, but I do not believe that the pain meds effected my judgment in what I was seeing in any way.  Although I’m a marine biologist, I’m first and foremost a scientist.  As per the title of that UFO documentary, I know what I saw – and would be most willing to take a lie detector test or whatever.  I would love to go under hypnosis to find out what was really going on, especially with that figure on the jetty I saw – so if there is anyone out there who reads this report and is near the Ft. Myers FL area or who would like to come out to our beautiful little Island, just let me know. NOTE – Since that Monday night, I and four other shark fishing friends had two UFO sightings of a different type of “craft,” and saw for about 15 minutes a very strange glow, about the shape and size of that last little bit of sun right before it dips below the horizon, just over the Gulf horizon (the horizon is 7 miles out, and we figured the light was emanating from 10+miles out).  We all figured that whatever was producing the light had to be absolutely huge (following Wednesday night starting at 9 pm).  We had two other sightings that night, and I had sightings of other types of UFO’s the following four nights.  Since that time it’s been raining just about nonstop.  I will write up the other reports as soon as time allows, and will submit them too.  Quick update:  I saw the same two amber UFO’s described above (or something almost exactly the same), plus an orange-red one, approximately 6 to 7 miles due north of where Carol and I saw the other ones (no, they were not fireworks).  Report coming soon.  The time frame of all of these sightings so far is about the same – from just as the sky is getting totally dark, to 10 to 10:30 p.m. Follow up reports:  Wednesday 5/26/13  Sighting #1 - I and four other shark fishing friends were on the beach on the south end of Captiva Island, FL, close to the rock jetty on Blind Pass.  At 9:10 p.m., with just a little bit of light left in the sky, we saw an off-white light traveling from north to south (traveling from our right, facing the gulf of Mexico, to our left).  The object was about the size of Venus when it is full, but much dimmer, and was about 60 degrees above the horizon over the Gulf of Mexico.  It was traveling about two times the speed of a jet liner, but was only about 3/5ths the height.  It was not a satellite, which I’ve seen at least 100 of. We first saw it to the north, about 35 degrees to the right of us.  It took about a minute or so to reach straight out in front of us, and which point it started going on and off, but not in a strobe fashion.  Each on-and-off took about one half a second.  It took another minute or so reach the same degree south of us as it was to the north of us, when it just blinked out.  I was watching it through 10X42 binoculars and it appeared a little bit orangish. Sighting # 2 -  near the had two UFO sightings of a different type of “craft,” and saw for about 15 minutes a very strange glow, about the shape and size of that last little bit of sun right before it dips below the horizon, just over the Gulf horizon (the horizon is 7 miles out, and we figured the light was emanating from 10+miles out).  We all figured that whatever was producing the light had to be absolutely huge (following Wednesday night starting at 9 pm).\",\n",
       "       \"Red tipped UFO Triangular shape/diamond shape addendum:  It came across the sky hovering from Shawnee Peak heading NE direction.  I was driving and noticed it from my left looking out the window.  I saw three or four red lights, seemingly intact, flying and or hovering heading ahead of me NE toward Rt 35 in Harrison.  The craft did not have ANY noise, at all. In fact, when the craft hovered over the line of pine trees, no wind or movement disrupted the trees, no windy swaying at all. The lights we bright red, but not bright by our means. It was a bright red like shining a light through opaque red jello.  They were chevron shaped, I was that close to it.  It only illuminated what was directly underneath the lights.  I was awe struck and then felt immediate petrifying fear when the craft descended into the pines and the lights went out.  I assume it landed when the light went out and then I floored it, and sped home doing 70 plus down Rt.35 to my home.    I'm having difficultly dealing with this.  I KNOW WHAT I SAW.  I was not abducted but woul! d love to take a lie detector test or have a hypnosis session.\",\n",
       "       'No cognitive memory of abduction, but physical signs of abduction. I have had sightings, strange happenings, extremely bad relationships, and various other abnormal occurrences in the past. I am 59 years old, of Irish descent with assorted physical ailments. I come from a military family, with my maternal grandfather having possible ties to CIA and other extraordinary facts about him. Since the beginning of July 2013, we have had more obvious signs that something is going on while we sleep. My boyfriend is adamantly against any of the theories I have about what is going on, but that could be his mind control. My mind control (for lack of a better term) seems to be fracturing. On the morning of July 1, 2013 I woke up feeling more exhausted than usual. While going to the restroom, I noticed a triangular shaped (series of dots) bruise on my thigh, just above the right knee. Thinking that it was curious to have that shape there, I took pictures of my leg. I will email those to you along with other pictures referenced later. About a week later, I had one on my other leg, same shape and same size, and was more toward the inside of my thigh, but I didn’t take pictures of that one. I wake up with various bruising and that sort of thing, but never think that much about it. These things are coming to be more frequent and definitely more blatant. On the morning of August 18, 2013, I woke up to having a very bloodshot (left) eye. I am emailing pictures of that as well. It feels like I have something in my eye, even after it has appeared to heal. I also had small bruises and a strange series of puncture holes in a crescent shape on the top of my left thigh (adding pictures).  Last year, I can’t give you a date, but sometime before September 2012, I woke up to a feeling like there was something in my left ear. My boyfriend has looked in the ear, but doesn’t see anything.It still bothers me sometimes. I find it more than coincidental that this is my left thigh (crescent shaped puncture wound), left ear and left eye. I have not been to a doctor for several reasons. I don’t have insurance, I don’t like doctors, and I am afraid of what they might think and what ! they will do to me. On Sunday, August 31, 2013, one of our American Bulldogs who sleeps in our bedroom woke us up at about 4 am in a panic. She is 110 lbs. and was attempting to hide behind the nightstand, and panting. We took her to the emergency vet, and they have found nothing wrong with her. We are in the process of running more tests to rule out physical problems. That is when I decided to do more research, look for investigators, support groups, etc. Whatever has been happening, is now affecting my animals, and that is not okay. They cannot speak for themselves and I have no memories of anything, so I need to find out. I am very determined to do so, I am finding it difficult to find anyone locally… If you can help, I would so appreciate it.

Showing me by a virtual reality show of their future response to events coming to our planet and our people.  I did not understand at that time that it was not coming then, I thought it was.  They did in no way harm me and in fact were very gentle, kind and loving, I was in no way afraid of them or ever felt threaten by them at all.

The ford pinto I owned at the time was going on and off, all the lights engine and radio. Then all of a sudden it totally died.  Lights, radio engine completely shut down. We got a flashlight out of the glove box and got out lifted the hood to see what we could see, naive as  neither of us had a clue what we could do.  I suggested we get back in the car and what until morning and perhaps hitchhike to any near town as we were about 35 miles from any town.  So we just curled up to go to sleep and then there was a small red light that went flying over the nearby farm field in a flash. About 5 minutes later my car came back on radio, lights and engine started right back up.  Because everything had shut down we had not turned anything off so it just came right back on. From that day to the day I sold it I never had this ever occur again or any electrical problems. In 77 or 78 when Close Encounters of the Third Kind the movie came out my brother called me from calif to tell me to go see this movie without telling me why. And there in the movie was exactly what occurred to us.  I was never one who was someone who read any science fiction stories.  I may have been a Star Trek fan and I have always been a believer in all things are possible. But I was never one who was looking for these kind of encounters or interactions. I was recently living in Montana and had 4-5 encounters there. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.  PD))',\n",
       "       'Large Black Rectangle with pulsing green light. possible time dilation. I was driving along going from colonial heights into petersburg one evening.  I noticed out of the corner of my eye in the top left hand side of the windshield a large, slow, black, and rectangular craft with a slow pulsing green light either the out lay was one large light in the center or four smaller one on each corner I cannot recall.  Of unknown altitude, size, or approximate knowledge of origin. I only really only know that when i try to remember the event it it very difficult and it feels as though that the event took entirely too long to occur.   I do believe that some type of time dilation was experienced.   Possible abduction but unknown.  No hypnotic regression attempted. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date is approximate.

       "       'White-ish/blue lighted sphere that changed to a white triangle over west Maui From the beach at Ka\\'anapali-Lahaina, Maui Hawaii looking west, my wife and I saw a very bright light above the island of Lana\\'i.  At first I thought it was a planet that was much brighter than usual, such as Mars but it wasn\\'t red, it was a very bright blue-ish-white, similar to Xenon headlights color.  At one point I had looked over to my wife to tell her to look at th bright light and she had asked about what it was.  When I looked back to see it, it had moved south and was slightly dimmer. At this point, I no longer thought it was a planet and started to think it was a plane or helicopter and shortly after we could see the shape go from a round shape that had a tint of blue, to a triangle shape that was more what and looked to have an obvious set of points.  Then I thought it had to be the mast light on top of a yacht or something and was thinking to myself, \"It\\'s gotta be closer than you think!  Is gotta!\"   I started to get my iPhone from my pocket but kept getting distracted by moving object that it took me a little bit to get it out and started taking pictures and video. I took a few photos that don\\'t imply anything special and look like a star or something.  I took a short video of just around 2 minutes and the craft is clearly visible as the light I described.  It\\'s hard to see the object moving because I was moving the camera. As my wife and I started to walk back the way we came (heading south, back towards the Hyatt hotel) and a ways away we came upon two women, in their 20\\'s and I asked them if they could see that light and they started talking about how they had been watching it move and thought it was a planet or a plane too.  So we started thinking about what it could be but as we came up with possibilities, we could de-characterize the behavior of the object with common knowledge of planes and helicopters.  Most moving aircraft will have at least alternating flashing lights on each wing or the top/bottom of the craft. They also don\\'t move in sharp, zig-zag patterns and erratic flight bahavior we saw.  Then the one of the girls said the same thing I thought about it being the light at the top of a yachts mast and that it could be closer than we think but we could see 3 yachts a couple hundred yards off shore very close to us that didn\\'t have lights nearly as bright on top and they were not ! moving like the craft in the sky. We all watched it move out over towards the direction of Lahaina. My wife and I said a few things about the event with the 2 girls and headed back towards our hotel and didn\\'t see the flying craft again.  The craft was obvious to us for about 20-30 minutes from when we first noticed the bright light to the point where we couldnt really see well any longer and headed back to the north side of Ka\\'anapali where our hotel, the Sheraton, is. We talked about what we saw and how cool it be to have finally seen a UFO. My wife asked if I was going to tell anybody about it and I said, \"I really want to! I don\\'t know who to tell though!\"  I asked her the same thing and she said &quot;Hell no! I don\\'t want everyone to think I\\'m crazy!  Nobody would take it seriously anyway.&quot; I said &quot;that\\'s true but we know what we saw!  That was awesome!&quot;  When we got back to our home on Oahu, we told our roommate and he started making jokes about it. &quot;Did it abduct someone? Could you see little green men flying it? Did you sing the melody (notes from \\'Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\')?&quot; and stuff of that nature were among the few jokes he said and even when my wife backed up my story, however reluctant, our roommate continued with his &quot;witty banter&quot;. I showed him the video I took and he still made fun of our encounter. I would think it to be very ignorant and nieve of us to think we are alone in the realm of all space and given that time is infinite in past and present, why wouldn\\'t others have found us by now? It would be equally ignorant and nieve to think our government has flying craft, capable of amazing maneuvers etc.  I cannot explain what I saw as a common aircraft or ship and I know it happened and there were others there to share in this experience. I\\'m glad and greatful to have had the experience.',\n",
       "       '5 individuals see Huge 300 ft Craft about 50 feet away for one hour.  Could throw rock and hit it. Early August 2012:  Large Craft seen by 5 individuals   I submitted the two earlier sightings to MUFON and to the National UFO Reporting Center.  I did not submit this following report because I believed that it was so unbelievable.  I only told this story to Mary Margaret Zimmer of the Miami MUFON when she visited me in late August of 2012 but to no other authority. I have been thinking about this event EVERY DAY since I saw it.  The most important item to retain in this quick summary is that I specifi-cally called this object--  it did not just mysteriously appear. After my wife saw the large UFO craft on July 8, 2012, I started to seriously begin my research on UFOs and paranormal issues.  I purchased numerous books from Amazon and spent all my free time on the internet.  I learned that many individuals (Steven Greer, Prophet Yahweh, and many others, call UFOS and then record videos of these objects. On a cloud covered night in the first week of August of 2012, at about 9 PM, a friend of mine called me and informed me that he was coming by and dropping off some of his traffic tickets.  I am an attorney and had previously told him that I will write up No Contest Motions to resolve these tickets for him.  He said he was close by and would be at my home in minutes.  I decided to wait for him outside. I live in a large cul-de-sac with only 3 houses.  My neighborhood has large yards and is very quiet.  It was dark and very cloudy.  I then decided to \"play a game.\"  I remembered the Steven Greer and Prophet Yahweh videos and started to consciously wish to see the large multi-colored UFO craft  my wife saw on July 8th to appear in front of me just like it did for her.  Approximately every 2-3 minutes I turned around 360 degrees to see if I saw anything.  I did this for about 15 minutes.  Just when I was ready to give up, I saw this huge object on top of my neighbor’s back yard extending approximately 200-300 feet back. The object was not a solid object.  It was made up mostly of thousands of streaks of circular or oblong shaped white thin lights.  It appeared to me that I saw two possibly three distinct outlines formed by the  oblong perimeters of these white light streaks.  One circular object nearest to me was partially covered by the palm trees in front of my neighbor’s house.   This smaller oblong object was connected to a much larger oblong object as formed by the perimeter of these light streaks.  There appeared to be hundreds of swirls of circular white light streaks all inside of this object. The object was positioned at a horizontal position rising at approximately a 15 degree incline.  It was positioned at about an 8 o’clock to 2 o’clock format.  It was about 50 feet from the bottom of the backyard of my neighbor’s house to the bottom of this object.  It is difficult to determine its height but I would say that the object was about 100-200 feet in its height.  I was clearly very long, I would say at least 300 feet in length.  (Attached are Exhibits 4, 5, 6, 7 which are drawings done by myself, my 10 year old daughter, my friend Luis, and his Wife Sandra). I then started yelling for my daughter to come outside.  My daughter had just turned 10 years old.  She had told my wife and I that both she and I had seen UFOs and she wanted to see one as well.  After about 1 minute of yelling outside her bedroom she came out and asked me “what was that”?  I told her that I did not know but believed it was a UFO in “hiding”.  She just looked at the object in amazement. After about 2-3 minutes of observing this object, my friend, Luis, who is 48 years old, his wife, who is 52 years old, and the daughter of his wife who is 17 years old drove up to my house.  Both Luis and his wife were trained as engineers in their native countries.  Luis is a conservative Catholic who was raised in Mexico.  He goes to Catholic Mass every Sunday and participates in various ministries.  He never believed in UFOS.  Both he and his wife were shocked and constantly asked me “what is that”.  We all tired to come up with logical explanations but we clearly could not come up with one that adequately explained this phenomenon.  We all doubted whether this was indeed a UFO and discussed that it must be some type of large light “anomaly”. Suddenly, all throughout the inside of the object, star light objects started to flicker on and off, flashing on and off in a fraction of a second.  I was surreal.  I believed that because we started to doubt this object, it wanted to put on a show for us to demonstrate to us that in fact it was very “real”.  It indeed was surreal.  We were not scared but instead started yelling— “look at that, look over there”—pointing to the stars bursting all over the different parts of the craft.  It was clearly putting on a show for us, or at least that was my impression. After about 15 minutes, my friends said they had to go and they drove off.   About 5 minutes later I believed that mosquitoes were biting me and I told my daughter that it was time to go inside because the mosquitoes were killing us.  In fact, my daughter told me later that there were no mosquitoes out that night.  After about one half hour later, I “woke up” and realized what a fool I was for just walking away from a scenario that should have been the front story of Time Magazine and every media outlet around the world if I had captured it on video.  I ran outside with my video and digital cameras but the huge UFO craft was gone. The ironic part was that about a month before this event, after my wife saw the huge multi-colored UFO outside our house, I purchased a large telescope, a night vision CCTV camera with adapters to attach this camera to the telescope, an old used SONY camcorder with the old night vision technology and a digital camera with high powered zoom for night shots.  I said to myself “the next time my wife or I see these objects we will be prepared to capture them on video and on camera so no one would doubt us”.  We know what we saw and they were real.  “Next time we are going to prove it.”  \\tThe irony was that it never even entered my mind to take any of these newly purchased items out and take a video or a picture.  About 30 minutes after I entered my house with my daugthter, I came to my senses and ran out with my camera and my SONY video but the UFO had disappeared.  I now have been educated through my various readings that I was “instructed” to go inside and not to take any videos or pictures.  I have learned that various individuals having “close encounters” have experienced similar responses— our minds were totally controlled. Since that first week of August of 2012, my wife and I have not seen any other UFOs or similar objects either inside or outside our home.  Every day I think about what I saw and have become compulsive over these sightings and these visions have affected my work performance and my outlook on life, our role in our universe, and our relationship as spirits with God.  I am a changed person. SUMMARY  \\tPrevious to these events, my wife and I have never seen UFOS or other similar objects in our life. My wife is not bothered by these events because she is very religious and thinks that these visions were messengers from God.  I, on the other hand, have been “freaked out”.  I started doing research on the subject of UFOs, joined MUFON, ordered and read about 30 UFO books, listen daily to Coast to Coast, etc, etc.  I never even knew that these radio programs or UFO organizations existed.  I am now consumed by the subject.  I need to find some answers and some closure because my wife says that I became obsessed with this issue. Finally, I am an attorney with the IRS in Miami, FL and my wife was trained as a physical therapist and is a stay-at-home mom.  As I stated earlier, I have various advanced professional degrees in addition to my legal training.  We live in an upper middle class neighborhood in the Killian area of Miami, Florida.  We have lead normal dull lives until recently.  Now I am consumed with my visions and spend most of my free time on the internet, reading books about UFOs, alien abductions, consciousness studies, Near Death Experiences, paranormal and spiritualist literature, Buddhism, past life regression literature, etc, etc.  Over the last year I have purchased and read over 100 books on these subjects and have recently ordered about 30 more.  My wife thinks that I have become compulsive and totally consumed by my new pursuits and I tend to agree. I have just recently returned from my first MUFON meeting in Miami, FL and have a recommendation for the MUFON investigators.  Instead of solely relying on “purely scientific” techniques and tools--  the principle approach which was conveyed to the audience— I believe that the key to solving this UFO riddle is to focus on our minds--  our complex “consciousness”, our complex psychic abilities. The fields of parapsychology, involving the decade long studies by Drs. Harold Putoff and Russel Targ at Stanford and Dr. Robert Jahn at Princeton, in addition to the new “consciousness studies” involving Dr. Edgar Mitchell and his Institute of Noetic Sciences, as well as the hundreds of other “Consciousness Studies” academics that publish in the Journal of Consciousness Studies, provide the keys to “understanding” this phenomenon.  I also recommend that everyone read materials from these authors in addition to the rarely discussed book entitled “The Irreducible Mind: Toward a Psychology for the 21st Century”, edited by Dr. Edward Kelly of the Department of Psychiatric Medicine at the University of Virginia. I know that I “invited” the entities of this craft to come “visit” me and that the “entities” in this craft made their “appearance” upon my “invitation”.  The key to solving the UFO quagmire is inside our own mind and spirit.  My latest event leads me to conclude that my mind, and other fellow human minds, are powerful and neglected instruments with powerful communication abilities. UFOs may not be from other planets in our universe.  They may be entities from a neighboring dimension as described in modern quantum physics.  It is very difficult to get a grasp what is going on with UFOs if one solely focuses on the “scientific method”.  The scientific method was developed to describe our physical universe and it does not adequately describe paranormal activities. Science has nothing to do with paranormal phenomena.  Science is based on the scientific method of discovery and experimentation.  The scientific method of discovery was devised for studying things in the physical universe.   Thus, when we are dealing with concepts outside of the physical universe--  things like the paranormal, UFOs, alien abductions, etc-- we are dealing with concepts outside of the physical universe and thus the scientific method breaks down.\\t  \\tNew methods and techniques of investigation have to be developed to study this phenomenon, and if we do not, the future UFO investigators will remain clueless.  We are now just starting to “academically” explore the universe of possibilities beyond our physical senses to help explain what is “consciousness” and various paranormal activities.  In my opinion, we need to be able to investigate beyond our physical sense of reality and it is this new methodology that will provide a logical avenue to address the riddle of solving the UFO phenomenon.',\n",

It didn\\'t look like a migration, they looked scared.  After I pulled out my phone camera and started filming, as the crows were above us, me and my friend blacked out and started puking out of nowhere for no reason.  It was the worst puke i have ever had. i stopped puking before he did, and i was able to look at him, and he was hysterical, he was claiming that something was in his head \"a worm\" like thing he could feel it.  He said his throat felt like something was shoved down it.  We were the only ones on the trail at that very moment,  We were very scared, because there was no reason for this to be happening.  It was like something took control over our bodies.  I have a feeling this was the work of an extra-dimensional alien of some sort, I just cant exp! lain why or how.

I was young at the time i approximate 8 years old, i was awoken by a flash of light at my window, i sat up in be, reached over to the window, peeked through the blinds, and saw what i thought at the time to look like an orange street light moving left to right, left to right, over the houses behind my property, this went on for a minute or so, then it disappeared, i laid back down in bed, then i heard my closet door squeaking as it opened, i looked, and coming out of my closet was a 3-4 foot tall being, which i have now been able to identify as a \"grey\" and he was looking at me, i hid under my blanket, and tried to scream, but nothing came out, i then blacked out, i remembered only the feeling of something sharp on the back of my neck when i awoke, i immediately went down stairs and asked my foster mother if i had a mark on the back of my neck, she said no, asked me why i asked, i said \"i think i was abducted by aliens\" she told me it mus! t have been a dream, because there was no mark on my neck, i accepted her dream idea, and moved on, then when this growth on the back of my neck began, in that exact same location, i began to investigate further, and i realized what i had gone had been seen before, the descriptions i had read matched my memories perfectly, since then, i have thoroughly investigated the phenomenon, and just found this site tonight, after another encounter which i reported 1st.

       "       \"BALL OF LIGHT MOVED AROUND IN THE SKY, THEN DISAPPEARED BEHIND MOUNTAINS. In October of 2004 I was hitch hiking to my favorite spot in Sedona AZ  to camp.  I had camped there the year before with some friends, and liked the seclusion.  I got dropped off on the main road and walked all the way in by myself to camp alone. The spot is just south of the city limits of Sedona, off of  highway 179 south.  There is a side road I cannot remember the name of you take east, and it follows a river. I was 18 at the time, and I guess I was very fearless, because I would be scared to camp there by myself now.  I did not believe in aliens at the time, to the degree that I do now. One night, while camping out on the river with not a soul around for miles, the weather looked like it was going to begin to storm.  I was sleeping on the ground, under a tarp out in the open.  I secured my tarp, and dug a trench around it to collect the rain away from my sleeping bag. Before it started to rain, I saw a very bright circle of light, that looked oddly close, and not outside the atmosphere, but rather inside it.  Sure enough, it start to move around, and vanished behind a mountain. I dropped to my knees in overwhelming fear.  Then the thunder storm came with loud thunder and heavy rain.  I remember laying there in paralyzing fear. Thinking back on it, I hope I wasn't abducted that night. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))\",\n",
       "       'Heard it 11-25-10 Saw it 1-4-11 2011 January 4 Sighting Report  On 1-4-13 at 6:58pm, I think...  I know for sure, it was the night that the tv show, \"V\" was going to air it\\'s new mid-season, an hour before that, the tv froze on a single picture, and I heard that same loud sound which I heard in my 11-25-10 incident report.  It is a distinct, sound, coming up from the east going westward, and this time, I figured by God, if it is a UFO, at least I am going to get out there to look: (see below regarding the 11-25-10 incident...). I opened my door so I could see through the storm door window and there, floating over my apartment building coming into view heading west, was the  typical saucer shape craft.  It actually had the same sort of curved shape at the ship in the tv show from the 60\\'s Lost In Space, your typical disk.  There was a black raised disk on the top, grey metallic in color, with a row of lighted squares in a ring around the craft - estimating from that, assuming these were half to three quarters the height of a man it was 3 floors, red constant lights on either side right and left, the craft did not rotate, and the bottom half looked much the same as the top but, no ring of windows, it had one white flashing beacon below in the center bottom, this light capped the bottom.  I would guess its width at 75 feet - 100 at most, height was I estimate a third to half as high as it was wide.  A very disc like craft, the entire sky around it seemed to glow a bluish grey light, like moonligh! t, which lit the craft quite well allowing me to see the detail of it, a grey silver lead like colored craft on a lighted background, the light surrounded and went with the craft. The object was at the height about equal to the building next door stood on end, no more than twice that in height...  Pacing it off, later in the spring, I estimated it\\'s altitude at a little more than 250 feet, 500 feet at most, and I watched it as it passed down range until it went behind the building next door\\'s roofline, this is a guesstimate but, perhaps 1000 feet away at the farthest when it was going out of sight.  When overhead, it was maybe 30 feet away to my south east and 250  feet overhead floating westward. As I said, this craft was so loud, though I have since seen it operate in silent mode.  It was almost as loud but not quite, as what I heard in the 11-25-10 incident  (see below) because, I figured it was hanging, right above, or resting on, the roof, the first time.  It had to be the same craft, or same type, by the sound if it, this is so loud, it sounds like the sky is tearing open when your right next to it (or in my case, I believe underneath it) t! hough that 1st time I did not see it. This time, though I did not have a working camera with film, I grabbed a small red laser pointer I had, and pointed it at the craft.  It did not react, so I began flashing it back and forth, this was when (I require glasses to drive and read signs and was not wearing them), I noticed that in what I thought at first was lighted squares, there was actually shapes in them and moving slightly, these were figures of living beings, I am fairly certain.  This was when I got the impression/feeling, that it was not a good idea, like they did not like this, flashing my laser around but, I was desperate for them to see me.  That was when as it went out of sight, I had the impression, given or otherwise, of course they saw me, that was why they were there, to let me, see them.  I feel rather bad about this, I have since read, that they do not like camera flashes, so, I doubt they liked my laser at all. I have since, seen this craft several times, and each time it has been either at a distance, behind the tree line to the west, or at a fair height overhead but, at no time has it come close again (each sighting was at night and it was not glowing like that, so it is harder to tell the height).  I hope someday, I can apologize in person, for the laser, maybe someday they will permit me a low pass again and I can get a few pictures the next time.  Previous Hearing Report; believe same craft... On Nov 25th, at 12:20am Thanksgiving morning of 2010, a morning when there was no snow to speak of here, in Holts Summit Missouri but there were fall leaves, on the ground...  I was watching my usual Thanksgiving movie marathon, laying on the couch in front of my front window (just fyi - the windows faced west) probably starting it around 10pm, I fell asleep about 11pm more or less, awakened suddenly some hour later, by the sound of someone walking around outside my apartment in the leaves.  This is not unusual but, we do have sidewalks and at that time of night, it is a bit strange, knowing each one personally, most of the people here then, were not ordinarily, walking around at that time of night and would not have been outside the windows of my unit. Being a bit sleepy yet, I opened the drapes and looked outside.  Seeing nothing, I thought perhaps, it was a squirrel, we have a number of large ones that live in the area.  I was, as I said, half sleepy but, moments later, when a small white light appeared over the center sidewalk between my 4 plex building and the 4 plex next to it, at a height of about 15\\', it caught my attention in my peripheral vision through the sheer drapes I had up at the time.  As near as I can figure, it must have been moving to this point, which is what caught my eye...at that moment it burst into the brightest white light I have ever seen, a blinding flash of light, with sparks trailing toward the ground which went out, at that exact moment of the flash, I felt, as much as saw it, like; \"zzzappp\" a very strange occurrence which I will not ever, forget.  I jumped at that, extricating myself from the blanket I was under, moving to the front door, which was at the end of the couch by m! y head, perhaps 30 seconds had elapsed since being awakened... I was about to open it, when I thought, wait, I have no idea who or what is out there, so, I carefully draw back the sheer curtains, look out again, and could see nothing.  I reached to grab the door handle and was about to turn it to open the door and go outside, when a loud roaring sound fired up, this was immediately over my head, like it was on the center of my roof area and it honestly, was so extraordinarily loud it scared the hell out of me.  It was like someone tearing the sky open!!!! Now I am a grown man, at that point in my late 40\\'s, and do not scare easily but, this was many times the sound of the space shuttle launch on tv, so loud it vibrated in my body and I could feel it, so loud, that I immediately dropped to a crouching position thinking perhaps the nearby Nuclear Power Plant that had blown up (a flash and roaring boom, it sort of, fit), expecting to be dead in a second I remained crouched down scared half to death but, it just got louder, and louder and then, this immense sound, began to lift away from my apartment roof...  This \\'loud sound\\', did not go west, east, north, or south, it went vertical, straight upward, and continued doing so, putting distance between it and me.  This was the first moment that I began to comprehend that it was something other than the nuclear power plant... As this thing lifted away it quickly got softer, then faded completely in about 15 seconds,  yes, I should have gone out and looked but, it was gone so fast, had I gone out, I doubt I would have seen anything, and I honestly, it all happened so fast, the entire event being perhaps 2minutes in length, and I was truly frightened at first.  Even as the craft departed, I stood there, hand on the door knob, trying to dummon the courage to go outside, I never did.  It may be easy to say \"I would have gone outside to look\" but, in that instant when this, loudest sound I\\'d ever heard, like being underneath a booster rocket of the space shuttle, was probably 20-25\\' from me, over the top of me, you can\\'t think, you just react and the natural reaction is to duck down and hide... The next morning I carefully walked the grounds but, could find nothing.  I asked around that day, all the neighbors, except the little 98 year old woman next door to me, whom was napping at that time of the afternoon, and no one said they saw anything.  One or two, said they had heard loud jets lately, and one woman said she heard, a low flying jet, late the night before...whether they saw anything and are unwilling to admit it, I can only guess. It was a couple of days before I had an opportunity to speak to the little old lady next door but, when I did, she said; \"Ohhh good, you heard that too\", that morning after midnight, she heard an extremely loud, roaring noise, and got up, went to her door and opening it, saw \"white smoke rolling at her away from the fence which boundaries the north side of the property (about 25 feet from her front door), immediately shutting her door, she returned to her bed and covered her head, terrified, she said.  I told her, I did not blame her, \"it scared even me, I have never heard anything so loud\". The really strange thing about this incident, well, one thing, was if this was a craft that landed or suspended over my roof, who was walking around outside my window while I slept.  Had they been inside?  Was I abducted, and have no memory?  What exactly was that, bright white flash?  Why, did I feel it?  Since then, I have seen this craft, in fact they are quite regular visitors now.  Are they interested in my area, in my apartment complex? In me?  I have many, questions?  No answers.... I have since this time, seen several craft which were, also loud like this.  Maybe the same craft, many times...  I know UFO\\'s are generally silent, which is odd but, this craft or one\\'s like it, though unseen on this occasion, returned many times, the next time, I did clearly see it (ie: above 01-04-11 sighting).  I had throughout my years seen lights way up in the sky moving oddly, blinking, etc., however, nothing I could absolutely say was a craft, or a UFO, until 2011. A friend and I were talking on our cell phones and I related this incident.  Before hanging up, I happened to say, I don\\'t know what, it was, but, I really would like to see one up close, I did only a couple weeks later, perhaps they were listening?',\n",
       "       \"4th sighting same craft 2011 March 16 Sighting  On 3-16-11 at 2:39am, I witnessed what I believe is the same craft moving completely silently that I had heard on 11-25-10, seen on 01-04-11, 01-14-11 and 02-05-11, very slowly following the same track it had on 1-14-11, the same lighting pattern, and it was close enough at perhaps a half mile, were it a helicopter, I should have been able to hear it, particularly that time of the morning.  Although, the craft, I had seen in the past, was loud, very loud, and this one, utterly silent, I believe, it was the same craft, or same type.  I watched it, until it moved beyond line of sight behind the trees and apartment building next door, in our complex.  About a half hour later I went to sleep..  At 5:10am, I was then, awakened by a very loud, low vibration.  I did not get up to see but, having seen this craft many occasions, I attributed this, less than 3 hours later, as belonging to the same craft, and went back to sleep.  I don't know if they are just interested in the area, ! which just west of my complex is very sparsely populated gor seversl miles, or me, or both but, I have had repeated visits, I hope will continue, and from the stepping up of their visit's, I believe this to be true.  The fact being that I slept after seeing the craft and was awakened by this sound, for all I know, there may have been an abduction, I really have no clue if I ever have been.  Also: reading this report just now,  I recall a helicopter followed shortly afterward.\",\n",
       "       \"Up close with a ufo abduction. I was driving back from Memphis.  It was erly in the morning I was tired.  I accidentally crouched north insted of going 40 west.  I took the first exit I could and decided to take that highway.  I'm driving ten minutes and I pass a house on my right in a valley it was lit like daylight.   I stopped because I'm woundering why.  I back up looked down the drive way it just was bright. In the middle of the night?  No I got to check this out.  So I got out and closed my door softly I didn't want to wake my girlfriend who was sound asleep.  I walked around the back of the car witch is sitting in the middle of the road.  I stoped listened crickets were chirping the tree frogs were crying for rain lighting bugs were lighting nothing was out place except for the two story waltons looking house lit up brighter than day!   So down the drive way I start slowly I get maybe ten yards and stop I don't know why.  I crouched down and then I saw what was bothering me.  It wasn't that the house was lit up brighter than daylight it was lit up inside and out bright inside and out.  WHAT how in gods name?  Then I crept a couple of feet and saw what haunts me to this day.  I saw a light round soft light then I started looking for the out line of what was holding the light.  It was a triangle shaped hole in the starsand it was big the light was the size of the house.  I was close anuff to toss a rock and hit it.  To say the least I was in aw.  To say the most I was in heaven because I'm a skeptic if I don't see it I don't beleave it and here it was something I can't explain.  let me qualify my next statement I am ex-military I worked on helicopters 68 be 10 was the job.  This craft was stable had no hum wine or rumble silent.  Im takeing this all in I'm seeing a large craft not man made wow!   My girlfriend woke up and started yelling for me I told her to come to me.  She got out car grumpy and started to where I was kneeling.   When she got to me started to speak and I just pointed to the light.  I must admit that was stupid because she started screaming when she saw the light we got run!  I asked her how they flew that thing here though space and a long way how did she think we could out run it in a car?  That made her stop and think she was scared unbelievably I wasn't.   I said lets look a few more seconds just then it got crazier a woman floated out of the light and in thought a coosed window.  I told my girlfriend ok I'm done get in the car this to much.  And we got back in the car and left.\",\n",
       "       'Orange glowing Saucer terrorized Cowboy his cowdog and four horses.weeks later a rangefire in spot where saucer last seen. This report may be long overdue but I can recall it as though it occurred last summer.   It was mid August 1975. I was watching over and taking care of chores at my stepfather and Mothers 22000 acre Beef cattle and Quarter horse ranch.  My stepdad had gone to our summer range at Greys lake Idaho to ride through the herd at that place.  The ranch where this event occurred is a remote Desert mountain ranch in northwestern Box Elder County, Utah.  There is not, nor ever has been any electricity at this\" Fort\" ranch.  It is isolated and even now quite primitive.  The 15th of August 1975 was very dry and very hot.  It was about 90 to 95 degrees F. at just before 12 midnite.        My mother was home, 80 miles to the east of where I was, she at our Logan Utah guest ranch, located on the Logan river..  The crickets at the Promontory Fort Ranch were chirping very rapidly outside the Bedroom window.  One can calculate about how hot it is by the speed that crickets chirp. that and I had inside-outside thermometers.   I was laying on the bed in the houses only bedroom reading a book.  The ranch cowdog  a Border collie was plopped down right next to me on the rug to the side of the bed.  I was reading by the propane powered lamp on the wall above my head.    I was 22 years old at the time,and I had 20/10 vision in both eyes.  This ranch is located 20 miles south by southwest of Thiokol Chemical Corp, where several stages of Intercontinental missle boosters and their propellant was made for the United States air force in support of continental defense/strategic Nuclear weapon systems, and later on, the NASA space shuttle solid rocket boosters. (1950 to 2005)  Now known as ATK space  systems and related subsidararies     The crickets stopped chirping.  The dog started fidgeting.  The dog started whimpering then whining this eerie mournful, pitiful cry, it got intense.  The poor animal began to exhibit terror at someone or something that was approaching. absolutely panic stricken.  Then, it started to paw and dig into the wallpaper and plaster of the rooms corner.  It tore clear through to the lath and was frantically pawing to get through even that.  I could not hear any sound, except for the freaked- out dog.   Then the horses started to act up and they became terribly agitated.  The horses whinnied and snorted.  They squealed and stampeded around the round corral that they were in next to the barn.  The barn was south of the ranch house and slightly below the main house about 20 yards away from me.   There were four saddle horses all of them geldings.  All of them gentle, with no previous signs of skittishness or jumpiness.  These working cow cutting horses were about as Bombproof, bullet proof dog-gentle-reliable as a mount could get.  At least before this incident.   They were desperately trying to get out of the corral and could not quite jump over the tall fence made of upright railroad ties.  I remember thinking that a rocky Mountain Cougar might be stalking my horses, so I retrieved all of t! he ranch weapons from their cache, loaded them and lay them squarely on the bed.  I short time earlier, maybe two months, a bobcat had been on the tin roof of the barn and had to be shot off, lest he sprang on the peafowl and chickens   That was another thing, none of the ranch chickens or peafowl seemed to be anywhere around and I didn\\'t see the black cat that was usually hanging around the porch.   Then there was this light.  The light was a  bright red orange.  It was more than bright, it was intensely bright, it was shining in from through  the west window.  I went over to the window to look.  I was nervous and had a vague feeling of apprehension about the situation up to now, but then I saw it.  It was a saucer.  A FLYING SAUCER!  the damn thing was positioned a little over a block to the west of the house.  It shone bright red orange.  The light was just glowing right out of the steel skin or whatever metal it was.  This thing was hovering about four hundred feet in the air.  It floated silently. there were no rotors. There were no propellers.  There were no jet engines, no rocket thrusters or any visible means of how it moved.  I estimate that the craft was 300 feet in diameter.  It was fifty feet high and believe there was a dome or protrusion on top. I did not see any beings or creatures. there were no windows or portals visible. It looked exactly like the shape of two tin pie pans hooked together into classic science fiction  Flying Saucer shape.  The strong light that it emitted cast shadows from the cedar fence posts , the fence line, the sagebrush and the greasewood all around and under it.the entire desert alkalai floor was lit up bright as day under and around it .there was a large alfalfa haystack near where I first observed this ship .The haystack cast a large grotesque shadow by this things light.  Again, it made no sound, but its presence and possibly whatever emanated from it scared the hell out of the dog ,the horses and me! I was crying, sweating profusely , and ready to pee my pants all at once. what wa! s most terrifying to me was, as I looked upon it   I suddenly knew it was watching me and it was aware that   I was there. THE best description of what it was... and this is deeply ingrained upon me; a living machine. It didn\\'t just strike me as being evil IT was evil. Malevolant not friendly or here to help mankind. also I just knew this thing was capable of killing with no qualms. I just knew this and other things about it, it communicated via telepathy , and I didn\\'t like it. I didn\\'t like it trespassing or being there at all and the living intelligent saucer read my mind enough to know that I would fight and resist  if I could. I may have been abducted . I do not think I was but I might have been. I don\\'t know how long I stared at it maybe  a few minutes. suddenly it floated over the house and as it did, the tin roof on the barn and bunkhouse rattled and so did all the dishes in the pantry then it shot off to the southeast end of the ranch to the pasture we call the ros! ebushes .it is a boggy wetland of marshes cattails and deed we! t and dr y sand .     many wild rows of rosebushes grow there.it is on the shoreline of the great Salt Lake located on the north end of one arm of the lake. this Craft hovered above the rosebush pasture twelve mile southeast. It moved from overhead to the rosebushes in much less than half a seconds time. The next development was two U.S. Airforce Jets approached from the Northwest.  these two jets in formation flew over the house at 1210 a,m. so low that the jetwash stirred up dust in the yard after they went by.  Probably didn\\'t help calm the horses down any as they passed either.  They were F-105 thunderchief Fighter bombers,  nuclear capable. before these heavy bombers got much past the house,  not even within 11 miles of the saucer, it shot right straight up and winked out. It didn\\'t fade off into space, like you could see it fade away with distance, it reached  a speed around ten thousand feet above ground level and disappeared.  The fighters continued on around the west side of th! e lower promontory peninsula and drose up in altitude curving around the point toward Salt Lake City  or Ogdens Hill Air force base,and they too were gone.',\n",
       "       \"Flashing amber colored lights that looked like a ferris wheel on it's side On a summer night in 1963 I was awakened from my bed by my mother. She also awoke my brother and sister.She told us to come to her room and told us to look out the window that over looked their field.  What I saw was an object setting on the ground about a hundred yards from our house. It looked like a ferris wheel turned on it's side and it was flashing very bright amber colored lights.  I watched the object for what seemed like 2 hours. I do not remember going to bed or falling asleep.  I only remember waking up in the morning.   The next morning we went outside and where the object had been was 3 burnt areas on the ground about 3 feet around.  My mother also only remembered waking up in the morning. I've always thought we may have been abducted.\",\n",
       "       \"I witnessed an alien war over Waxhaw NC MCP - Celebrating the New Year and thought I was just witnessing fireworks.  I saw a lot of explosions in the sky, but instead of colorful geometric formations, I kept seeing huge fireballs followed by mushroom clouds.  Apparently aliens were having a war in the atmosphere.  6-7 UFOs shaped like discs and piloted by Grays were shooting lasers and neutron missiles at each other at an altitude of 95,000 feet. It looked like the UFOs were blowing up when they were hit, but their shields protected them.  I saw one Gray eject from his spacecraft after several direct hits, but he parachuted into another craft then took off back into deep space.  The worst part was getting abducted.  A UFO landed in my driveway and the pilot got out and asked for several wooden boxes of uranium.  I told him I had some in my basement, and when he went and looked I snuck onto his spaceship and started going through his things.  He came back and caught me.  Things got really out of hand at this point and I'm too embarrassed to say what happened next.\",\n",

It was hovering over the highway mostly in the middle of nowhere around 800 feet up slightly quavering from side to side.  It had a little bit of an irregular red tinge inside the white hot major luminosity.   I got that 'it wasn't 'right' feeling about it and checked my watch- it was 10:08 pm.   I seriously thought of needing to 'get past' it without being abducted and 'losing time'.

       "       \"Hovering orbs inside my bedroom and alien figures outside my window.  Possible abduction It was about 9:30 PM. I was alone at home, reading a book in my bedroom.  My kids slept in their bedroom in the basement.  The lights were all off, except my reading  light on my headboard. I was focused on my book when I saw something from the corner of the eye. I immediately felt chills.  Looking, I saw that there was nothing.  So I continued my reading  for a few minutes until a flash of white light lighted my whole bedroom.  Then I saw three white spheres the size of a basketball floating in the air at the height of  the ceiling.  I felt terrified.  The spheres move synchronously in spirals around the room.  Spheres of light emitted a hum.  Spheres illuminated the room.  With a yank,  the spheres have stopped moving and vanished. My heart was beating too fast.  I looked at my phone and it was 10:34 PM.  Reassured, I told myself that I had probably dreamed of this observation. I instinctively looked out the window.  What I saw completely hurt me.  There was a total of two beings standing, looking at me through my window. They were about 4  feet tall, big heads, big slanted black eyes, no nose, only nostrils.  They looked at me with a terrible stare.  I could feel anger towards me.  I was sweating cold  water.  I was terrified.   Suddenly, they disappeared in a matter of seconds.  I felt reassured for a second, until something cold grabbed my legs and my arms at the  same time.  I couldn't move, they were holding me tight.  I could feel something cold inside my skull, as if someone was touching parts of my brain.  It was a really scaring experience.  A really uncomfortable feeling.  Everything went black and I passed out. I woke up next morning at 09h52, with a terrible headache.  Something happened last night. I will never be the same again.\",\n",
       "       \"observed a still standing white silver red light blinking. Dear National UFO Reporting Center,                                    1/26/2014    I do not claim to be abducted but there are a few stories I would like to share with your facility.  I also would like to report a possible UFO sighting. When I was about twelve years of age I was sitting on my grandparents roof experimenting with cigarettes.  At that time back in 1996 my grandparents home was surrounded by hay fields and about 150 yards from a rural residential road on the Wind River Indian Reservation.  I happened to look up out into the hay field and right where a irrigation ditch is I had seen a green and red and white light changing colors.  I could tell it was only about five feet off the ground. I had thought it was another kid out in the field with one of those toy flashlights that change color.  I do not remember climbing down off the roof nor do I remember going to bed. (this was about 10:00 pm)  Through out my teenage and in my early twenties I had never given the sighting another thought. when I was a teenager my grandmother had given me the book ''Intruders'' by respected Budd Hopkins.  The book had sat in my bedroom closet for years collecting dust. I did not read the book until the summer of 2013 and I started remembering the strange lights I had seen out in the hay field.  I am a Native American and as you probably know my heritage is  strongly influenced by the supernatural and paranormal.  After reading Intruders I was thinking ''what would a little kid be doing way out in the hay field at night'' then I theorized that maybe it was a alcoholic walking through the field with one of those toy flashlights'' because there has been a lot of alcoholics in my community who would walk out in the fields to someone's house. I spoke with a Native American shaman and had described what I had seen.  I did not go to him for help we are friends and we was talking about the talk show ''coast to coast'' the medicine mad had told me that he thought that it was not a human nor was it an evil spirit roaming around that it very well could have been something from not of this world. I truly believe that it was something extra terrestrial. Another incident that I would like to share is that when I was twenty six I had a very strange dream that seemed real. I felt like I was awake and conscious but at the same time it was a dream. In this strange state of mind I had seen several green orbs floating around me. something or somebody was speaking to me but I could not hear a voice nor could I speak. The information I had received was in my head. I know there is a word for it but I can not think of it right now. I think the word I am looking for is telepathy. As these green orbs were floating around me I was told that if I do not do this one certain thing that I would be killed. I strongly believe that extra terrestrials were communicating with me. I don't know how exactly but I feel in my heart and with all my soul that they were in fact ET's. I have thought this through a lot and am very confused as to why would they threatened me like that? I sometimes think that mayby they were not being malicious but giving me a warning and trying to help me because at that time I was in a very dangerous situation where my life was actually in danger. In Native American Culture we do have stories of ''star people'' coming to earth and visiting with tribal elders. These ''star people'' are not out to hurt or destroy humans. I strongly believe that aliens are real but I just cannot accept the thought that I was abducted.....here is my UFO sighting.... I was laying in bed with my curtains open and there is a big pine tree outside my window. I had seen a blinking white or silver light through the tree branches and thought it was a star. I got up about twenty minutes later and had noticed that the light was gone. I was looking out the window and had noticed the same light hovering over the Wind River Mountains on the Wind River Indian Reservation. I thought to myself that cant be a star why did it move like that? I thought it was an airplane then I realized if it was in fact an airplane then it would be moving but it was just sitting there blinking it was mostly white/silver and as I peered at it longer and concentrated on it. I could see it change to a faint red color and it was just sitting there blinking. I know now that it was not a star no an airplane and the only conclusion I could think of was that it must have been a UFO. There have been reported sightings on this Reservation of bigfoot but never has anybody reported seeing a UFO. I personally think  that by becoming interested in aliens and reading Intruders and listening to coast to coast that somehow I attracted ET's . I have never seen a ''grey'' only the strange lights as a child and the green orbs in my dream. I am a recovering alcoholic and marijuana addict. I have been clean and sober for three years so I know what I saw the other night was not an hallucination. I was in a very normal state of mind. Anyway the strange blinking lights I had seen was just sitting there not moving. The lights were right above the Wind River Mountains on the Wind River Indian reservation. Thank you for reading my story and please take into consideration my sighting of a possible UFO. God bless! ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the incident is approximate.  PD))\",\n",
       "       \"Large, silent, high-flying speedy aircraft with triangle light alignment frightens skeptic. 9:30 pm last night. First off, I'm a lifetime skeptic in every sense.  I've never seen a UFO or anything that I couldn't think of a plausible explanation for.  I don't believe in ghosts, bigfoot, chupacabra, or alien-abductions.  I'm a college-educated guy who has always had an interest in science and technology.  I wasn't on drugs or drinking.  I have no history of mental illness.  My assumption is that last night I caught a rare, brief glimpse of some kind of stealth aircraft of some sort.  That assumption doesn't make the vivid memory of it less discombobulating to me. Last night was clear and starry.  So clear and nice that I had gone outside to watch the International Space Station do a pass-over just after sunset.  Later in the evening I went outside to smoke a cigarette.  The sky seemed even more deeply dark and starry at that point.   I was smoking and gazing up at the constellation Orion, wondering what the name of the bright orange star in the constellation was (it's Betelgeuse.)  Because i'm so curious, I pulled out my iPhone and launched an astronomy map that identifies stars.  It uses the phone's accelerometer to label stars and planets as you point the phone around the night sky.   After satisfying my curiosity, I put the phone back in my pocket and returned my gaze to Orion when suddenly a fast-moving triangular set of solid reddish lights caught my eye moving from zenith down towards the Orion's belt.  The direction was from NE at zenith to SW when it disappeared after a solid, enthralling three seconds.  Absolutely no sound whatsoever!   The diameter of the perfect triangle was the width of about 2 of my thumbnails held at arm's length. It disappeared right about parallel to Orion's belt to its right.   I felt speechless, like I had seen a ghost for the first time.  What was so striking was that it seemed to be massive, supersonic, and flying at a high altitude.  What implied massive and high altitude, to me, was the fact that at no time during those three seconds did the individual lights in the triangular formation seem to change position in relation to one another.  If the object were lower, the fixed lights would have appeared to come together as it continued on its straight course to the SW.   It was also disturbing to not hear any noise.   I'm unsure how to accurately describe its speed, but the speed seemed tremendous when including the lack of perspective distortion of the lights.  The lights were orange or red and of similar brightness to a constellation like Orion.  But this thing was booking it.  It instantly seemed unnatural and part of some type of technology because of its perfect symmetry and straight-line path.   I'm still kind of in shock. I'm still looking for some kind of explanation.  I've thought of every angle to debunk my own vivid memory of it and can't think of anything.  Some kind of meteor which had its light perfectly refracted into a triad by the atmosphere?  I'm not an astro-physicist but I wish Neil Degrasse Tyson had been with me to witness what I saw.   I have been looking up at the sky all my life.  I have seen meteors, comets, satellites, aircraft, weird weather….I have never seen anything like what I saw last night.\",\n",
       "       \"LONG BEACH, CA.. interacted with a UFO while stargazing and using a Green high output laser beam. so i was star gazing in my back yard as i normally do and i come across a star i think is moving that may just be a.  i recently purchased a green laser which emits a visible beam 5miles, like what you see in the military.  i come across what i think is a satellite . so i point my laser at it and it seems to have moved away from it,  i thought i was tripping or maybe had shaky hands so i position myself against my step fathers truck to get a posture while pointing and using my 2 hands instead of one. Here comes the crazy part.  As i start pointing my laser at this object i notice that it is moving and not moving in a single direction as you would see with a satellite.  this thing starts moving left, right, side to side almost trying get out of my beam as i point at it, i do this for about 2 mins until i start feeling like i should tell some one but know one at my home was home and nor where any of my neighbors in their backyards . So what do i do ? well, i thought since i am seeing this and i cant tell know one nor video tape it i get the idea to start circling the object as to attract people to looking at it instead of me pointing a laser directly on it.  i want to add that this idea came because i live along side the 710 fwy and i know for a fact people can see my beam from far so i new i can maybe get some people in traffic to see it and i hopefully was successful with that cause what happen next gave me the chills up and down my spine and i still have the chills as i write this. also i want to add that this isn't the first time i seen something i cant identify, but it is the first time i ever interacted with one . As i start circling the object it get more aggressive to moving away from the light as if knowing i am circling it and in doing so giving up its position , i continue to do so and it keeps trying get out of the circle i put it in, i then notice that when ever the beam would be in front of its direction it will quickly move away from it as if it was scared of crossing it as weird as it sounds.  i know this wasn't a satellite nor a plan cause planes cant move that fast nor in the aggressive manner this object moved.  I then start to notice that this object is positioning itself over my house , pretty much right over me so at this point i am pointing straight up with my neck looking straight up to the point my neck hurts . i got kinda freaked out at that point even more and start thinking about all abduction movies and thinking maybe this thing is position itself over me to know my location, i don't know but it really freaked me out . now my laser starts dying which emits a le! ss visible beam that can bee seen , at this same time i notice the object starts to also fade but still remains over what looks to me like its directly over me but just in the heavens with the stars pretty much hanging out flying around. my laser then dies and honestly i felt alone at that moment cause i was in complete darkness and it hit me that what i was seeing was real and was interacting with me and my laser beam . i stare at it for a couple mins more , noticing that its not really moving anymore but staying directly above me where it positioned itself in the heavens.  my lasers off,i am in darkness, i start getting more freaked out thinking that maybe its gonna get me , beam me up , i just start thinking of all the movies i seen with people interacting with ufo's which never end well. i wont lie i start feeling fear in me and something telling me go inside the house and recharge my laser. i do so , and decide to report for the first time an experience i have with a ufo that to me is the scariest encounter i have ever had the privilege of seeing . since a kid i have star gazed, i am 29. i have seen many weird things in the skies i cant explain to this day which i am sure allot of people have seen things many times also if they star gaze frequently thru their life . what i saw was real and i really cant explain any more into detail about it but what i explained . i haven't gone back outside my house yet and do plan to after i finish this sighting description . honestly i am kinda scared to go back out and look at the sky and or see if its s! till in the same spot but i am only because of my curiosity and faith that nothing bad will happen to me .  it looked exactly like a dim star or satellite that moves in a single continues lane that many people i am sure have seen . it didn't make any different colors it just stayed white like the stars , it moved quick, it moved away from my laser as if it were scared of it or didn't want to be seen or pointed out. i don't know what it was but know it wasn't a plane . i really wish i had someone over tonight to be my witness . i actually bought the laser because i would frequently see things through out my life in the skies, that i just wanted to finally point them out when star gazing and hopefully show other people . sadly i was alone and still am , my report is done and i hope who ever reads this maybe gets the same idea with the laser pointer and or someone saw a green beam pointing along the 710 fwy at an object moving away from my beam in the skies high above the heavens , at 9:00 pm . this is is not a hoax. hopefully some one has seen something similar or interacted with a ! ufo as i have with a high output green laser beam .\",\n",

As I was saying my prayers with my eyes closed, lying in bed I felt like someone was watching me outside of my bedroom window.  I opened my eyes and saw a light staring down at me from up in the air like a helicopter about 300 feet away. I felt like my thoughts were being probed.  I think they could feel I was scared and they mirrored back my feelings.  I hid under the covers on my bed and then I became like I was frozen stiff and unable to move. They took me out of my bed holding my wrists, were leading me down the hallway.  I screamed for my dad. Telepathically they told me that he couldn't hear me.  I think everyone on my block was like under ether or something.  I don’t remember going up into the saucer. The saucer was round with a see through dome from the inside out, night or day. I could draw great pictures of UFO’s in school.  My parents blew off my story after I said , “I saw a saucer last night”.  My mom said on the way to the kitchen, “Gee I thought I locked the door last night”, it was open in the morning.  I can remember all conversation and think precisely when I get an adrenalin rush. As they flew me to the mother ship, I remember vividly sitting down in the middle of the ship with the dome window behind them and I was afraid to let them think that I could see them as they stared at me.  I pretended not being able to see them. There was one alien that wanted to Communicate, maybe the navigator, the other two were standing in back of him, and they just watched and never tried to communicate ever.  We went to a larger ship. I remembered the docking port.  How we docked and the dome part of the saucer had a bottom rim that fit into the docking port and became attached to the ship, and as I was going aboard getting on board I remember the mesh floor and a small box next to the bulkhead, and the round top of the saucer fitting into the hole under the mother ship had lifted up.  I remember how big the ship was inside because it appeared small and was large inside. He told me when the tests started and over and over telepathically that it all would be over soon so just wait a little bit longer. Most of the things that happened above I could not remember at first but was reminded by other things as I lived my rest of my life. I saw one recognizable abductee that was very familiar on TV years later and she was complaining about her experience of being used during the abduction. They let me see the space view of the Gulf of Mexico at night, with the city lights from New Orleans to Tampa.  I remember the color of light aboard the ship as the sun was coming up, They showed me a ray gun.  The end of it had a shape similar to a filament that hangs electric wires from telephone poles.  Because of their telepathy they can feel things that their body never feels through your experiences.  Maybe they try to get some of our features to benefit themselves. I was on their ship more than once, because of my scoop marks. I even saw a hooded figure that scarred me standing next to a cement slab.  They told me how many kids I would have. I saw a projection of my wife years before I got married. I believe aliens look a little oriental. They will step in to our world if they think we are going to destroy our world. It is like controlling the bad fish in a fish bowl from breaking the fish bowl. All that happened when I was 8 years old in the UFO flap of 1952.  The UFOs flew over President Truman’s White House and were as were seen flying up the east coast as reported by Eastern Airlines pilots, on route to the north from Florida. When my parents moved houses in Miami they moved in back of Norman Beans house, a MUFON original board member.  Coincidence or not, you be the judge. When I get reminded of more I will add more.

       "       'Object seen the night Mars was closest to Earth August 27, 2003. August 27, 2003.  It was the night that Mars was closest to the earth and I was staying at my son & daughter-in-laws apartment on top of a mountain that was a rock quarry off of Camp Creek Rd., Springfield, OR. My son asked his wife this night if she had seen ‘Mars’ and she said no, so all 3 of us went out of the apartment (it was attached on the end of a very large metal shop building) and as we walked outside there was a Very Bright Light, my son said “see there it is” and I said to him,,, “No, that is not Mars, it is more to the Southeast, but I don’t know what that ‘bright light is’….. As we got to the end of the building there to the South was ‘Mars’, and we looked at it and then at the ‘Bright Light’, that looked like a Star,,,, we all walked out to the clearing on the top of the mountain and was looking at this ‘Light’, and all of a sudden it went Vertically UP… not far from what one would estimate in ‘height’ but then I got the distinct feeling it was coming right at us…..”I yelled to my Son and his wife “get back to the apartment quick”, my son said as he was running he was going to get his camera and being 6’3” 195 of solid muscle ran quickly to his pick-up and grabbed his camera and ran to the apartment door where his wife and I were (there was a little cover built over the doorway),,,  My son looked up and tried to use his camera (which he used every day for work but it would not work) as we all looked up “There was this Beautiful Object just above the tree tops that had the most Amazing Lights I had ever seen in my life”, I kept saying…. “Wow,,,, look at those lights, they are beautiful”, and my daughter-in-law wanted to run out under the object and I held her back and told her “NO…. You can’t go out there, haven’t you seen the movie “Fire in the Sky”????  She said NO, and even though I didn’t know what we were looking at…. In my subconscious mind I knew it was not something to investigate. The object only stayed above us for a minute maybe two… but as fast as we ‘blinked our eyes it was gone’!!!  We ran to the other end of the building and could find no trace of where it had gone….. I told my daughter about it the next day and she told me she was listening to CNN that morning and a couple reported seeing a ‘bright object that looked like a star in the sky that same night we did and it came towards them as well’…. I tried to contact CNN to get information about the couple but never got a response. This really did happen and after we went inside, my son stated that “we just saw a UFO”, it was like we were mesmerized when it was above us, but we lost no ‘time’ in this encounter and none of us have had nightmares or dreams that have frightened us so I do not believe there was any encounter with whoever was in the object. This actually did happen to all 3 of us and I am grateful no ‘encounter’ happened to us or that we were subjected to any abduction from ‘them’!',\n",
       "       \"odd helicopter sighted, landed, and strange phone call, too We heard voices telling us a helicopter would fly by low and land down the street and it did.  Probably right down the street at about the only location we realy know about there. someone used to spook us when we walked by that house as a kid.  The aliens seem to remind us recently of things that we had thought of and forgot.  They help you to remember the scary things so you can forget them because when we originally thought of them we forgot without thinking of it and becoming unscared of it.  It was something scary and they helped us remember it so we wouldn't be scared no more so we can put it out of our minds. So, the helicopter flew real real low by the house someone told us on the  phone day before yesterday.  It had happened the day before and they had just got a real real weird phone call about 15 minutes before we called.  It had real real weird static on the line they said and they hung up. It wasn't usual and hadn't happened ever before.  Don't know what color the helicopter was or much on how the call sounded.  They said the helicopter flew real real low and the call was real real weird though.  They said it was an airlift because of a car crash.  They said it landed down the street first - flew weird though.  The car crash idea was probably just something they thought of to make sense of it. It surely wasn't one and at first they just said that it was a real weird helicopter flying strange and landed.  They didn't mention a car crash.  Didn't mention the main road.  They mentioned a weird flying helicopter is what it was.  And nothing of any cars or anything like that- just that it ! had landed. So the other story of the car wreck and air-lift was not realy what it was. We thought of a helicopter that flew by here low recently and voices said they'd make one fly low there, too.  They said it'd be the Hells Angles outlaw motorcycle gang- just like flew by here many times very low outside our window.  That is how they do death threats- they are a mafia organization. So, then the voices said aliens fly by and land down street in helicopter and you just think of an air lift due to a car crash would be why they'd land like that. Helicopters landed down the street here before, too. But the voices said landing there and aliens or mafia and that they knew a car wreck would happen or they would cause it to happen. Realy, it may have been aliens or else the hell's angel's mafia organization maybe - perhaps possessed by aliens and landed there. Don't know what it looked like or what the occupant's looked like. It landed so that is unusual. The call was weird- at same time the mafia calls there daily which would be when we woke up the day before. They ca! ll and tell lies on the phone because that is mafia activity. They lie on the phone and tell them the same things we said the day before at the same time we said them the day before. It is meant to make them trust them- sound familiar to the person so they trust a stranger. The hell's angel's do lot's of murders for money and that is what that is. They work with other mafia organizations, too such as Georgia mafias which is what some of them are out there. So, the aliens called the next day, too and did weird noises on the phone. Static maybe copying that song by the band who did 'love shack' because we thought of that song other day, too. Maybe aliens put the song in our mind. B-52's is the band name. Channel Z song- maybe we used to think the song was ufo's or something related to it like ufo's contating you telepatically. The aliens may have reminded us of that idea that we'd never have remembered otherwise. don't know if we ever thought that realy. Or we used to think t! v's were weird or something- like the film Poltergeist. The vo! ices may be were helping us forget soemthign that scared us though by reminding us that we thought of it and forgot it before we calmed down over it. So we could remember it and forget it. So they landed and just basically also annoying us with voices and scaring us. It was a helicopter, but it maybe was aliens and it landed- don't know if it was black. Rape is associated with a ufo landing spot where an alien was sighted in the vicinity. It landed and one was sighted apparently at least. If it was the mafia or not we don't know, but that itself is ufo related because it's alien related because aliens have something to do with a gang that kills thousands of innocent people every year - mostly in the southern us. They work with other mafia organizations, too though a whole lot- we know because we have seen them. And they are international, too a-lot we know because we have seen that, too. We'll have to ask about the color of the helicopter and what the occupant/s looked like. They abdolutely did not at first say it was a car crash and air-lift via helicopter. They said it flew by real real low! It had landed down the street! And all you could figure out is why they'd do that would be an air-lift to the hospital from a car crash maybe on the main road. Why else would it be there? Is it legal to land personal helicopters wherever you want like that? In a residential neighborhood and flying that low- they said it was terribly low. We've seen low planes before because we have seen ufo's before and aliens flying low. This was even lower apparently. Real real weird static on the phone the next day and they hung up the phone they said. So it's not normal and it does not even sound like a prank call. I have got calls from ET's before and here we have stopped answering the phone. The alien/s called maybe just to freak us out seems like and they may have been ordered to phone us up from time to time like it's their job by a top alien. We heard a voice saying they'd be a weird call and there was- with static real weird on it- and it was. The day before we had tried to call out there and they were on the phone to the mafia. The mafia calls and lies and tells them things we said day before at the same time they call there the next day. It's to gain trust and they had called and were on the phone lieing to them out there to make them think they have something in common with them- to sound familiar so they will put their guard down and trust them when they shouldn't. So calling people like that would cause ET's to get there beca! use the mafia is doing very violent type of thing by doing that. ET's being evil have something to do with it. So there's the mafia and also we don't usually call out there and we recalled that. Aliens maybe wanted to remind us of that and how bad it was coz they hate us out there of course. We had to call though because there was important business needed done and you can't do it in 2 minutes once a week here in town realy. We had to do things about buying groceries, clothes and everything and we had to call. They maybe wanted to remind us - did we get mad and freak out and say we weren't calling and to remind us to calm down over whatever we maybe thought on that whole thing if we heard voices on it or whatever. I heard about it via the voices 1st, they saw it and surely many others saw it there in the town. Aliens could fly a helicopter and even abduct people or animals onto them and make people think it was an air-lift.\",\n",
       "       'Saw 3 objects in sky and a creature. UFO sighting, chase and possible abduction.  Charlotte N.C., May 5th, 2014. I am submitting this report because I feel that people should know what my adult daughter (28 years old) and I went through.  After over three weeks later we are still upset and still not our usual selves.  I guess we are both still in shock and we are not sure what to do about it. It’s hard because we only really have each other to talk to about it and my daughter is still having stomach problems and just wants to forget what we saw.  I can’t get it out of my mind.  I am still scared. I still can’t believe that it happened at all.  But, I know it did! We know it did. On May 5th, 2014, around 8:30-8:45 PM, we were driving through Charlotte, NC, on the Southbound side of I- 77.  I noticed a really bright light off to the right of us up in the sky.  This huge thing was just floating there in the sky.  It was no plane.  It was silent.  My daughter was driving and I was in the passenger seat.  I just kept asking, “What is that?”  Her reply was that it was a plane because it had blinking lights.  It did have blinking lights but they were pretty insignificant compared to the huge bright white string of lights that seemed to be at the front of this thing.  The smaller lights looked like they were on top of it. One to each side of the center.  The white lights were very large.  I couldn’t see past the lights to see what shape the object was.  We were kind of arguing about what it could or could not be. I grabbed my cell and took some photos.  I actually caught two pictures of the lights and I also turned on my cell’s video to try and catch it that way.  I caught it on video too but it is very small and all you can see is a white light off in the distance.  It’s pretty shaky.  I’m not sure if I can pull it in to see it better or not. As we drove through Charlotte on 77 we came to an area where there are street lights right next to the highway.  Tall orange/yellow street lights.  I could no longer see the object because the street lights were so bright.  All of a sudden a huge round ball of solid bright white light came right at the windshield.  Out of nowhere! It took up most of the windshield and she drives a four door Toyota Corolla.  When it came for the windshield I braced myself for impact. But it didn’t hit the car.  It just kind of seemed as though it evaporated into it.   At that moment my daughter was driving over 70 mph.    As I sat there dazed, I was thinking that one of the street lights must’ve fallen on the car but there was no sound at all and I was having a hard time trying to grasp what had just happened.  I hadn’t said a word to my daughter about the light when she asked me, “What was that light?”  I was like, “You saw that too?”  Then I told her “I don’t know what that was!”   That scared us pretty badly.  Her stomach started to hurt really bad and she was nauseous and my stomach was hurting too.  It seemed to just take all of my daughter’s energy away. She started feeling really bad.  Not only did this light scare the crap out of us but it “STUNNED” us.  We were actually dazed by it.  We don’t know where the ball of light came from, but we didn’t see it again.  We both remember actually feeling it on the skin of our faces and upper arms. I remember that I looked in the side mirror a few moments later and nothing was there.   A little while later a huge helicopter flew right over and in front of our car. It was so close that we could see the two greenish/blue light domes stuck underneath it and a tiny little blue light on top of it, under the blades.  It was a huge helicopter and it was very loud. Because of the blue light I thought it must be police or military. All in all we saw the chopper three times or three different choppers. They were circling the area where we were. So, we couldn’t have been the only ones who witnessed the object. Not sure if anyone saw the round light that came after us. I did notice that the helicopters didn’t actually seem to approach the white lights that were still in the sky. They just circled around the interstate. The last time I saw one of these helicopters was when we were leaving the Charlotte area. Once we cleared the street lights we could still see the lights in the sky were still there. Then the road turned so that the object ended up behind us. I was determined to get some pictures of it so we took the next exit so that we could see it from on top of the over pass. Well, the next exit didn’t go up to an overpass. It angled down. We ended up surrounded by trees and buildings. So, we couldn’t see it anymore. We were going to go to the next exit to see if it had an actual overpass where we would be able to see it again and that’s when my husband called. It was 9:08 PM. I frantically told him all about the lights in the sky and the ball of light that came at us and about the helicopter. I wasn’t paying any attention to my daughter who was still driving until she said, “Mom, I don’t feel good!”  That’s when I noticed she was driving about 85 mph and she told me that she couldn’t stay awake. I told her to slow down. I got off of the phone.  She told me that she had been nodding off and that she couldn’t drive anymore.  We had eaten in Huntersville and we left at dusk.  I’d say a little after 8:00 PM, she was full of energy.  Our trip to where she lives was only 3 ½ hours away from Huntersville and she was fine.  She was fine until the white ball of light came at us. I told her to pull off of the interstate so that she could rest and that I would drive the rest of the way.  The exit we took had a Denny’s so we went in there. This Denny’s is located in Rock Hill, S.C.  As soon as we walked in, we realized it was freezing.  So, we reluctantly walked back outside to the car and opened the trunk to get our jackets.  Everything in the trunk was hot. Even the metal of my camera’s tripod was hot to the touch.  Our jackets were toasty as though we had just pulled them out of the drier.  That was when we started to worry about radiation.  Worried about where that ball of light might’ve come from. Everything being so hot really shook us up all over again. (We don’t know where to go to have something like that checked out. Who do you call to see if your car or you have been exposed to radiation? If anyone out there knows; please get the information to me.) When we went back inside we sat down and ordered coffee. We sat there trying to rationalize what had happened. She was still nauseous so she decided to get something to eat hoping she would feel better. I didn’t eat. My stomach felt bad and I had no appetite at all. Strange thing is that the clock on her cell and the register receipt didn’t match. The receipt said we left there at 10:05 and my daughter had gotten a call from her husband while we were at the table and the time read 10:46. That would mean that by her cell we left there after 11:00 PM. I know we weren’t sitting there for that long. I called the Denny’s last week and spoke to a manager to see of the register’s time was off. But, it was accurate. I can’t explain the difference. I wish I could say that our experience ended there. But, it didn’t. We got into the car and I drove back to I-77.  After I had been driving a little while, I spotted the lights again. We couldn’t believe it!  They were over to the right of the interstate, just like before.  (When we had left the restaurant I made sure that we got my video camera and Cannon camera out of the trunk.)  So, I told my daughter to grab it to film the object, so she did. I couldn’t help her with it because I was driving.  As she opened the view finder she tried to focus on the object when it seemed to come straight towards our car! She just said “ It can see us, it’s looking at us!” She said the white lights went out and now there was a line of red lights under it. Then it flew over the car. It went from the front passenger side to the rear driver side and then across the street. By this time it was moving very slowly and low. The whole thing turned slowly like it was facing our car while staying in the! same spot. She is so scared and at this time I can’t see it. She can, because she is looking over the seat through the window behind me. I pull the car off to the right side of the slow lane. Strangely there is no traffic except for us. Now, I can see it! As we watch this thing together; it started changing shape. I ask you, how does something just change shape? The fact that it was in the air is what scared me! We could see what looked like metal beams drop down from I guess inside of this thing and it looked like they were interlocking. The beams looked like 2 x4s but seemed to be made of metal. It was changing shape right in front of us. We could clearly see it because it was right there and the red lights illuminated it. It’s outer shape was starting to look like some sort of a triangle. That’s when I put the car back into drive, hit the gas and took off. I need to say this now; my daughter doesn’t own and has never used a video camera. (Except for one time when I was recording something and handed it over to her to use.)She thought that just because the view finder lights up and the screen is showing what you are pointing at that what you see is being recorded. She never hit the little red button. Later when we realized this we were crushed. I do not blame my daughter. Now, here is where I made the worst decision of my life. At this time we are in South Carolina and are between Rock Hills and Columbia. As before, I wanted to see more of the object so since it was behind us I started to look for an overpass again so that we could sit up high and maybe my daughter could get some more footage of this thing. When I took the overpass to the right, stopped at the stop sign then headed left onto the bridge/over pass as we looked at the trees in front of us there was a large glowing hovering bright creamy white object that was about 50 feet wide if not more. I don’t know if it was the same object we had just seen but if it was it had changed color and shape again and was chasing us and waiting for us. As soon as I saw it I slammed on the brakes. I remember hearing the sand and gravel crunch under the tires as I skidded to a stop. I had driven all the way across the bridge and was sitting in the middle of the road on painted lines that showed that ! the lanes were separate. We were in shock. It was at tree level and we could see the outline of the tops of the trees on both sides of the road. I could see that the road we were on went in between those trees and looked like it headed off to the right. There were no lights anywhere on or around this overpass. We were just sitting there, stunned.  Staring at that bright light. When my daughter said, “You aren’t going near that thing? Are you?” I told her no. But, as I realized later; I still wasn’t leaving either. I can’t explain that. I was terrified but I wasn’t leaving. I don’t know how long we sat there. I think it was just a few minutes. Then we were hit with headlights from the right side of us. Someone had taken the exit from North bound side and had pulled up to the stop sign facing right at our car. That snapped me out of it. I took my foot off of the brake and swerved to the right and around to the left to make a u turn in the street and headed for the ramp back to I-77 South. I am ashamed to say that we did nothing to alert the other car. We have no idea if these people saw it or not. All I know is that the object was still there when I took my u turn. I never looked back. Once back on the interstate I drove for quite some time when finally I just had to pull off. By this time it was after midnight. I took a well lit exit and saw a Wendy’s but it was only open for drive through. All of the gas stations were closed. All the while I’m checking the skies. So, I got back on I-77 and looked for another exit. That’s when I saw a Shell station sign and took that exit. It was on the left side so we had to go over the overpass. We could tell it was closed as soon as we came over the overpass. All of the parking lot lights were on but it was closed. I was in pain because my bladder was hurting now. I pulled partially into the entrance of the Shell station and then made a u turn. As I completed the u turn we saw a guard rail right in front of us. At the very end of the guard rail as we were swinging around we saw something  standing there. I couldn’t take my eyes off of it. It was right next to the road. Right next to the door of the car. It seemed to be! bristling. Like it was luminescent in some way, but it was really darkly colored like it was camouflaged. I actually thought it was someone dressed up in that camouflage netting stuff when it moved towards the glass right next to my daughter. She put her hands and arms up over her face and head and tucked her head downwards. That is how close that thing was to her door. I honestly thought it may have been a poacher until I could make out the shape of it. I could see a larger than normal rounded top of a head then it came down to a short little neck area then straight out to both sides to shoulders. (Human shoulders aren’t shaped that way.) Then it’s arms dropped straight down.  The thing that made me realize that it wasn’t human was mostly that it’s waist was only like 8 inches wide and that it was about maybe 4 feet tall.  I could see from the top of it’s head to its hip area through her window.  I remember thinking “It’s so skinny!” Next thing I know we are past it and my  daughter is asking me, “Was that a person?”  I remember looking  back over my right shoulder through the window behind her and still seeing the thing.  It was moving and I had never been so terrified in my entire life.  My daughter said that she didn’t look at it but then moments later she said that it was really thin.  I remember asking her how do you know that if you didn’t look at it?  She still can’t answer that question, but is adamant about not looking at it. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke with the witness via telephone, and she assures us that the report is sincere.  She will have her daughter submit a supplementary report.  The mother has offered to send two photos she asserts she took of the object(s).  PD)) I somehow find the ramp back to the interstate and just drive. Finally, I spot what looks like a truck stop. I know they are open 24/7. As we take the exit there are semi’s parked to the right side of the exit. As I passed them I could see that it was open and now I had a place to use the rest room.  Even after seeing that thing I had to use the bathroom so I just had to stop.  Once I was finished inside I came back outside to the car.  We sat there for a couple of moments trying to absorb what we had just seen. I didn’t know what time it was then and just got back on the road.  My daughter had to get back home that night because there was no one home to take her three dogs outside to the bathroom.  That is the reason we hadn’t stopped and gotten a hotel. While driving I ran into construction three separate times where signs with arrows pointed us over to the slow lane and the speed limit was only 45.  After the third road maintenance/construction site I had had it.  I told my daughter that I just couldn’t take it anymore.  I had to pull off and get a hotel.  Two exits later we found hotels and stopped for the night.  It was 2:00 AM.  The hotel was in Orangeburg, SC.  We were so shook up that we didn’t get to sleep until 5:00 AM.  We turned all of the lights on in the room and bathroom. We jumped at every little sound.  Even sounds the little refrigerator made.  I woke up at 6:00 AM and realized that we had fallen asleep.  We were both sitting up leaning on pillows stacked up against the headboards.  I finally turned off the room lights when the sun came up enough to light the room. I just can’t get the image of the creepy little thing out of my mind.  Even right now, I can still clearly see it in my mind.  Every time I get the same feeling of outright fear.  We think we were still being followed.  Then again, maybe this creature was separate.  We don’t know. I do guess that the larger lights that we saw were not what we saw change shape.  That object was much, much smaller.  So was the glowing light we saw at that over pass. We are still afraid. Writing this down has taken me all day long.  It’s still very upsetting. We don’t understand why it chose us.  Was it that we were taking too much interest?  Again, that would be totally my fault.  At points during all of this she was begging me to get far away from what we were seeing. All in all it took us four hours to get 1 hour and 43 minutes away.  The time it usually takes to drive from Rock Hill to Orangeburg.  We got off of the road a couple of times but still feel that we are missing time somewhere. ((ADDENDUM FROM WITNESS)) Dear Mr. Davenport, Can you tell me where people who have witnessed a UFO go when they want to speak out loud to someone about what they saw? Do people ever get answers to what happened? It took me about 7 hours to physically write down all of what happened that night. It was very hard to have to keep reliving it so that I could write it down. My daughter and I went over it a hundred times while I was still at her house but now it\\'s like pulling teeth to get her to talk about any of it. She feels that we never should have been there. Never should have seen what we saw and that we shouldn\\'t tell anyone. She doesn\\'t understand why I feel the need to let people know what happened to us. What we witnessed I think it\\'s important! All of it!  I want to know what that ball of light was!  Did it leave radiation in/on her car? What happened to my left ear?  Why is there a \"New\" bump behind my right ear and why does my daughter have one in the same area? Why were my triglycerides through the roof when my blood was tested 7 days after May 5th? They were so high that my doctor called me at home to give me the results. I remember that I was asked by the tech\\' when my blood was drawn if I was on any blood thinners when he drew my blood. I am not!  I am still very scared at night.  If I have to go outside for something alone at night now, It takes everything I have not to fly into a panic and run when I see any lights moving in the sky.  What if it knows where I am or worse, where my daughter is?  Please, accept my apology for being so rude in my reply to your email before.  I have not been myself lately.  ((END ADDENDUM))',\n",
       "       '7 fireballs hovering high over Woodbridge, VA. My friend and I had been skateboarding out front of my house when I had noticed 7 stationary fireballs in the sky, with no particular formation, behind the treeline.  I asked him what he thought they were and he laughed it off saying \"Huh, maybe it\\'s a UFO, man\" and continued skating.  I ignored his comment and kept my gaze locked on them for about 5 minutes, watching them disappear one by one. I have also had people tell me of abduction experiences involving my back yard, with them having no prior knowledge of the abduction phenomena, coinciding totally with public accounts.',\n",
       "       'I encountered three \"people\" who walked into a light pulsing space-craft. While driving down the Chemin-Saint Bernard road on my way to the store I saw, in the distance, what appeared to me to be Police sirens (on the right side side of the road (opposite the train bridge).  I slowed down figuring that there must be Police up ahead, maybe an accident etc... as I approached the two bridges and slowed down (both are full sized but only one allows for cars the other one is part of a walking path) I noticed that there were three people all dressed in tight black clothing leaning on the rail of the bridge looking at whatever it was that the Police were doing.  I put on my hazards and pulled over to the side. I got out of the car and approached the onlookers. I took a look myself and didn\\'t see anything except the flashing lights directly ahead, which appeared to me now a little less like \"flashing lights\" and more akin to \"pulsing lights.\"  I turned to the man on my left and asked him \"what happened?\" the man turned, looked at me, said nothing and then turned his head back to it\\'s original position.  (Note 1: They all had dark hair and eyes)  I then leaned forward to see if one of the other two would answer my question and, nothing. One member of the trio was a female and she had shoulder length dark hair. It was also then that I noticed that the skin of their faces was a little odd. It reminded me of what a woman looks like when she puts on a little too much foundation. I didn\\'t think much of it at the time, I was much more curious as to what the Police were doing down there.  (Note 2: There were two males and one female. The two males appeared like Caucasian men and the woman looked like a South-East Asian. Maybe even Mulatto. Another thing I didn\\'t really notice at the time was that their chins were a little bit more \\'pointy\\' than usual and all of them had the same chin.)  (Note 3: Their clothing was, in retrospect, very... VERY tight,  it was almost as if their clothing was \\'painted on\\' rather than being actual clothing. Their pants were like tight cargo pants but had three big pockets across the length of the leg rather than one. The males and Female both dressed alike.)  I wanted to get a better look so I left them and headed to the other bridge via the walking path. When I looked down from the second bridge I saw a Delta shaped object that was \"pulsing\" red and blue light. The craft itself looked black and very smooth/shiny.  This is when I started to breath a little heavy ... slowly starting to take in what I may be looking at. I have never seen anything like it. The craft itself was about the length of an average tow-truck and about 30 ft wide at the widest area. The craft was silent and made no noise. It also didn\\'t seem to have much impact on the water it was floating above (probably hovering at 2-4 ft tops).  While I was looking at this thing I heard some rattle and rocks being moved around. I looked to my left and saw one of the \"people\" coming down from the other \\'path\\' (this path is to the left of where I was and is not as clean cut) I shouted to him \"You have to see this!\" he didn\\'t even acknowledge me and kept walking to the other side and down towards the shore.  (Note 4: These \"people\" were not aggressive. They seemed not only to not acknowledge me except for a brief look, but, did not even seem the slight bit concerned that I was looking at whatever I was looking at. They walked very calmly. Even when it was obvious that I was about to put two and two together. It was like they did not care.)  A few moments later the other two started walking the same path and very calmly headed towards the shore. When they were all assembled below the bridge they started walking towards the craft, female first, and then walking INTO the craft. No doors (at least that I could see/hear) they walked into the craft as if walking through a wall.  The pulsing lights stopped. The craft then started moving (it also began to emit a faint buzzing sound that was somewhat... hypnotic).  The craft then switched on a pale blue light underneath it and then started to accelerate slowly to about 35 KM/H towards the Saint-Lawrence.  I started to panic! I had been within a foot of whatever they were. Maybe they would come back for me? Maybe there were others on the way!?  I ran back through the path that I had came through, got into my car, jumped into the seat and after a few tries finally got the key into the ignition and took off down the road (turning into Rene-Levesque street). About 5 minutes later... Still breathing hard with a heart that still felt like it was going to burst from out of my chest I got off the road and parked in a parking lot. I took my cellphone from the hand-rest ... I wanted to call a buddy of mine and tell him what had just happened, maybe meet up for coffee... I just really didn\\'t want to go back home!  (Note 5: I don\\'t remember turning my engine off when I pulled over, but I might have.)  Anyways I looked at the lock screen and it read \"1:57 A.M.\" That was IMPOSSIBLE, the whole experience only lasted at max 15-20 minutes! I looked at my watch (digital) which said that it was 11:08 P.M, I toggled my cars display and the car also said the same (it actually read 11:09 P.M)  I drove to Tim Horton\\'s and their clock said 2:05 A.M  *If 3 hours really did pass I have no recollection of what happened during that time.  *I do not believe that I was abducted. I have no memories, no physical scars and no headaches etc. I feel perfectly fine, a little shook I guess, but, fine.',\n",
       "       'Low Frequency makes house feel as though it would implode. We were asleep and heard what we thought was a plane flying overhead. Slowly, a low frequency began to sound.  We (my wife and I) thought it was a low flying plane. The sound began to get louder and louder until we thought our windows were going to implode from the low frequency sound.  After about a minute the sound stopped and everything in the backyard (see below)there was an abnormal silence. During the incident the backyard became very dark (this was odd as the moon was a few days past full) and the nightlife was completely still.  No crickets, no other insects were making the usual noise.  We are close to two large bodies of water. Our dogs and cat did not move during this entire episode. My wife believed the incident began at 03:30, however it began at 02:37, as the clock is closest to me and the numbers are large enough to see without wearing corrective lens. I am not certain if this was an abduction as we both do not remember anything from 02:37 to 03:30.  Needless to say my nature makes me skeptical, but this experience was mind-boggling and frightening all at once.  The loss of time cannot be confirmed with any certainty.  There may have been aircraft in pursuit, but if so they missed the object. Has anyone else had this type of experience? ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date is approximate.

       "       'Possible abduction.   I don\\'t exactly know where to begin.  To be honest I don\\'t even want to speak about it, but I feel like someone should know what happened. Before I begin.  You must understand I don\\'t want anyone to know about what happened.  I don\\'t want to become famous.  I don\\'t want to be known.  I don\\'t want to make money off this.  I don\\'t want to ever speak about it again it scares me so much.  This is the truth as best as I can tell it. It all seemed like a dream except there was a physical sense of reality and feeling. I went to sleep around 10pm.  In a room with another person sleeping in a bed next to my bed, similar to sharing a hotel room.  I go to sleep.  Everything was normal. I regain consciousness to what seemed like a hospital room.  The first thing I noticed was I was laying back down on what appeared to be a hospital bed.  Immediately I assume I\\'m in a hospital.  As I realize there is no way I could be in a hospital I began to look around.... I notice the walls of the room seem to be of a metallic color.  This freaked me out because I know hospital rooms have bright colors and do not have metal walls.  This is when I went on a defense mode.  I started trying to understand my surrounding environments and the more details I noticed the more confused and scared I became. I make a quick glance to my right and I think I saw 2 people.  Near my feet another 2.  Then to my left a person sitting in a chair perpendicular to my \"hospital bed.\"  My attention is struck by the person on the left of me in the chair.  At this time I realized I was unable to move almost like being asleep but awake at the same time.  Maybe I could explain the feeling as in a coma but with a mental awareness plus I could see everything. The person to the left was a female human.  This I know for sure. I was so scared I remember her telling me it was ok and it would all be over soon.  I then look at her as she puts a needle in my left arm.  Similar to how an IV needle is placed but different.  Their technique of placing the needle required no tape or gauze to hold it in place.  Which I have never seen and I have been in the hospital before so I know how IV needles are placed.  The needle itself was metal but it\\'s luster was odd.  I can\\'t remember if it was too dull or too shiny. But I know for a fact the luster was off.  Nothing I have ever seen before possibly an unknown metal. So, the lady to the left of me said there was nothing to worry about.  When I heard that I went from defense mode to panic mode.  Nothing to worry about to me means your screwed and you can\\'t do any thing about it.  So I tried to move but couldn\\'t.  Then the real panic and fear set into me. Again you have to understand something about me.  I am NOT scared easily.  I am not weak.  And I have no problem facing fears or going into combat.  So for me to be scared out of my mind.  It truly speaks for itself.  Anyways.... The last thing I remember seeing at that point was the person in front of me (one of the people by me feet).  They had what seemed to be a wire connecting to an led flashlight (that\\'s what it looked like) it was all white and I could see the \"led bulbs\" in the \"flashlight.\"  I was explained through a mental communication that this was a way to know or decipher something.  I think it was to know who I am or to locate me or something.  It was done for a reason I just can\\'t remember exactly why. The flashlight thing was designed so the placement of each bulb could be measured through its complex variations and measurements so that it could be calculated to individually differentiate people.  In essence to separate them or track them.  Not sure exactly what or why.  But it didn\\'t seem to be in bad intent. They literally touched the lights to my right foot.  I didn\\'t feel any pain or anything.  Just like someone touching your foot with a flashlight.  I blacked out after that. I woke back up in the same room.  No idea how much time had passed by. No one was in the metal room.  Just me by myself. Near where my feet were, were the person holding the flashlight was, there was a door. Same color as the walls.  Metal.  I go through the door.  (Now it gets hard to explain). It was a diagonal hallway.  On one side (opposite of the door) it was a solid metal flat wall.  Maybe 100 feet long from what I could see.  I went 10 feet to the right.  Saw a door. Opened it.  It was the same looking room I was just in.  I close the door.  Start walking down the hallway in the opposite direction.  I pass maybe 10 rooms identical to what I just came out of. When I get to what seems to be a pivot point In the ship I almost shit in my pants.  I could only imagine the ship I was in being the shape of the letter V.  The pivot point I speak of would be the intersecting plot point.  When I got to that spot there was a giant window.  Maybe 30 feet tall 75 feet wide.  And when I looked out the window I saw earth.  It was glorious to view.  Making me realize I was not on my own planet. I panicked needless to say.  Then I saw beings walk by me. Not human.  The one I focused on had an olive colored skin. Looked wet but dry maybe like a lizard or snake.  The face looked like a (Mexican x Asian x African) in facial features (nose mouth eyes etc).  The strangest thing about them was they had what looked like fish gills, on the side of their face, where a humans cheeks are.  Almost like slicing a persons cheeks to look like gills or flaps.  They must have been 6.5-7 feet tall. I asked the being if this was all real and it grabbed my hand.  Next thing I know I regain consciousness inside my own bathroom.  I was stuck staring in the mirror in my bathroom. When I snapped into reality I realized I was in shock.  I looked where the needle was inserted into my arm and there was a blood spot or scab (coagulated blood).  When I realized I was staring in the mirror I noticed I was hallucinating (sort of, it was a feeling not a visual).  I felt like I had been in the ocean all day, got out of the ocean, and still felt the waves.  Or like I was skiing on a mountain all day and got off he mountains and felt like I was still skiing.  I also came to realize that at this point it was 6:45-7:00am.  Almost 9 hours had passed.  I felt so tired like I hadn\\'t slept all night. My hallucinations wore off a few hours after the bathroom.  I came to the conclusion that the hallucinations had something to do with ((what)) they did to me. A few weeks later a spot identical to the shape of the led lights to my foot showed up.  They have never left i still have the physical marking left over from what they did even to this day.',\n",
       "       '8/00/1972  or 8/1973 Waukesha, WI for 20 minutes, a sun-like oval object cited April 25, 2014 In the summer of 1972 or 1973, I was dating my ex-husband in Waukesha, Wis.  We were kissing goodbye on the back porch, and we both saw an oval sun looking object on west horizon at 1:15 a.m.  Due to the rolling hills in Wisconsin, you can only see 5 miles in the distance, at the most.  My father was a volunteer fireman, so if there were any fires in a 10 mile radius from our farm my father would have been notified.  I observed there were solar flexes coming from this object and they split from the middle and went to the outside edges of this oval object and it disappeared.  I thought, I am going to keep my mind open to figure out what I saw.   My ex-husband and I moved to New Mexico, on September 14, 1973.  In 1975, I was watching a movie of Barney and Betty Hill who were abducted by aliens.  Betty explained when the space ship took off it was engulfed in flames and as it took off the flames dissipated.  This is what I saw in Wisconsin.

The craft was white inside every corner rounded off. He freaked out when he saw the greys and ran into another room on the craft to get away from them. He started pullin wires and almost yanked out a box in this engine room. One of the greys spoke in his mind telling him if you rip that box object out the ship will go down!! My dads said what one of you greys said that?? One raised his hand and walked up to my father and took his hand. He took my father in a room wwith a floating table and strapped him down with a sheet that sucked his body tight onto this table. Two shinny needles come out of the ceiling and go directly under each of his eyes. They tolk him they can take his soul out of his body and pute it into another body. He awoke on the ground on a ladies lawn. The u.f.o he was on floating above him unti! ll he got up in left. The aria is rural packed with woods. The lady came out asking what happened to him. I saw recently 3 huge orange shaped round objects I know you see many. I also used to get paralized while living with my dad. I also think I have a chip in my leg.',\n",
       "       \"Red light appears, disappears, and the reappears in a different spot; followed by white/violet lights flashing like sparkles. I have been a skywatcher and UFO researcher my entire life.  I know where most (wandering stars) planets are and a decent amount about where the constellations are.  Look… You know when you have seen one.  There is no question.  Something lets you know that this moment is different from everything else you have witnessed.   This is the second sighting I have witnessed in two years.  The first was two years ago (a white orb) between June 6-9, 2012, and just yesterday June 10th, 2014, at 23:00 hours; approximately a year and a day later, which I find to be significant in itself. Mostly cloudless night, upper atmosphere clouds scarce.  Red light gradually appeared out of no where around 160 degrees SW.  Came into focus for 3-5 seconds then dimmed out the same way it came into focus.  Red light then reappeared at about 125 degrees SW a bit lower on the horizon and disappeared in the same fashion as before.  Then at about 33 degrees on the horizon and at about 135 degrees SW appeared several flashing white/violet lights the size of stars, but within our atmosphere, like sparkles flashing randomly but yet sequentially.  My friend and I both witnessed the event. My First Sighting:  The person I saw my first sighting with (different person from this most recent sighting) told me a story in 2010 about being brought up (abducted) and would not discuss it again when I confronted him on the subject at later dates.  I knew for about a year or so I was going to see one soon and was watching the sky intently.  Later that night I asked my friend if we should report it.  Him and his brother said the next time I can report it. I replied to them both by saying, I don't know,  I have been waiting my whole life to see one; it's kind of a once and a lifetime experience.  My friend said no maybe in a couple of years and it became clear to me he knew this to be a future factual happening which it has now turned out to be.  There is more to this story; a big piece.  I'm not going to write about it.  Too difficult.  Contact me.\",\n",

       "       'Very strange circular craft clearly seen at close range by two people. My girlfriend and I went on a date on Friday, November 13, 2009.  Directly after dinner, we drove to a rural but not uninhabited area to look at the stars.  The night was cold, so the sky was very clear.  We parked on the side of Hunt Road, a dirt road in New Haven, Vermont , sometime between 8:00 and 9:00pm.  There are houses and farms along this road, but we selected a spot where the road crests a hill, bends, and runs through a couple of wooded areas.  This helped to block any lights from nearby houses.  Hunt Road runs parallel to and one-half mile east of Route 7, a relatively busy 2-lane state highway and the main north-south road on the western side of the state.  With houses around, and a busy road less than a mile away, we were secluded but certainly not in the middle of nowhere. \\tWe sat on the hood of my 2000 Chevy Malibu and looked at the stars for maybe 45 minutes to an hour.  We saw several shooting stars during that time.  We got cold, so we decided to go home.  We got into the car, and we were talking about shooting stars. I turned on the vehicle.  Just as I finished putting on my seatbelt, I saw something off to the left in my periphery.  When I looked, I saw an object above the trees at about 9-o’clock, directly out the driver-side door window.  I would estimate the altitude of the object at around 200 feet, and it was at a distance of about a quarter mile.  I immediately realized that it was very strange, and that I had no idea what it was.  A part of me may have already thought that it looked like the descriptions people give of alien craft.  Almost as soon as I saw it I said, “What’s that?”   My girlfriend had already seen it, as well, and she said, “I don’t know.” \\t As I said, when I first saw the thing the thought immediately popped into my mind that it looked something like a stereotypical “UFO” with a few peculiarities.  I then had the realization that of course alien craft do not exist, or at the very least that it was very unlikely that I was staring at one, so I began to try to figure out what it could be.  An airplane? A balloon? A reflection? A remote-controlled toy?  All of these things were easily ruled out almost as soon as they came up, leaving me staring at the object as it passed from the driver-side window to the windshield.  My girlfriend and I were hurriedly discussing what this thing could be, but we kept coming back to  ‘What the heck is that?  Look how it moves.’  I don’t remember if either of us said that it looked like an alien craft, but I know that we were both thinking it. \\tThe thing passed in front of the car, and it became clear that it was going to go behind some trees.  The leaves were down and it was just a row of trees, so it would still be possible to see the light moving behind the branches, but we would no longer have an unobstructed view.   By this point the objects flight-path brought it closer, and it may have been one eighth of a mile away.  My girlfriend said, “Follow it!” I said, “Are you crazy!” It moved directly in front of the car, and I reached down and flashed my headlights at it four or five times.  My girlfriend said something like, “What are you doing?” in a way that implied that I was bringing danger upon us.   It began to move behind the branches just as I was finishing the last flick of my headlights, and then it abruptly disappeared. It should have been visible through the branches.  I stepped on the gas and sped past the row of trees, and behind it was an open field.  The craft should have been right there, floating over th! e center of the field heading toward the mountains, but it was gone.  There was not even a light in the distance.   We sat there scanning the area and the sky, which we had an excellent view of as we were on a hill.  The thing had completely disappeared. \\tThe object itself was shaped somewhat like a circular ibuprofen tablet.  It had flat sides and a slightly curved top and bottom.  The top was a very slightly tighter arc, and so protruded a little more than the bottom.  I believe the object was 40 feet in diameter.  Against the sky, the color of the object was a dark gray. I could see its outline very clearly.  I saw no evidence that in light the object would have been shiny, but I suppose that is possible.  I saw three rectangular lights on the flat sides that seemed to me to be windows. The lighted areas were completely opaque, and I could not see into the object at all.  The lights were all the same color, a very vibrant and yet very soft yellow.  The object did not spin around, but as it was moving diagonally to us I did see the light nearest the rear of the thing move more in front, and the light nearest the front moved around behind it somewhat due to our changing angle of view. \\tThe strangest aspect of it, and the thing that for me rules out almost everything except for alien craft was the way that it moved. I cannot describe it to you accurately.  It moved forward and up in one motion (in ratio about 2 or 3 parts forward, one part up), and it did this in irregular “spurts”.  The spurt would be a sudden motion…no acceleration at all, it was just suddenly moving forward and up. The spurts were very short, sometimes there were three of them in one second, other times there might be 2 seconds between them.  These are maximum ranges, as there was no discernible pattern or rhythm to the timing or length of the spurts.  In between these pulses of speed, the object coasted (forward and slightly down).  Again, with no deceleration period…the object was just suddenly moving slower.  It sounds as though that would look jerky, but there was an odd fluidity to it.  Put these together, and it did not move very quickly.  It did not coast as an airplane does. It lost al! titude slightly when coasting, but there was definitely something of a hovering characteristic to it. Its general speed was not constant.  The moment that there were three spurts in one second, the thing lurched forward maybe 100 feet, but it did this in a very quick, yet intermittent fashion that is impossible to explain. It was very, very unique.  It made no noise at all. \\tAfter it disappeared and we were then unable to locate it where it should have been, my girlfriend and I agreed not to talk about it on the drive home.  The time was suddenly 11:00pm. I don’t want to say that we were missing an hour or two of time because I have misjudged time in the past, but we both wondered how it had become so late.  I do not believe I was abducted.  The plan was to get home, each make a drawing of what we thought we saw separately, and then compare.  Our drawings were identical in every way but one. I was under the impression that if we had seen it from above, it would have been a perfect circle, while she was under the impression that it would have been oblong.  The drawing of the object that I have included is the drawing I made that night, about an hour after I saw it.  The map I drew is very accurate and to scale.  Later, we researched UFO’s a bit to try to make sense of it.   What we saw certainly fits in with other UFO sightings, though I have not seen a UFO photo anywhere that fits perfectly with what I saw.',\n",
       "       \"Saw flashing lights in night sky that then appeared as large UFO Ok so it took me a few years to report this but it is such a vivid memory that describing it now is just as easy as the night i saw it with my three friends.   To give a little background i was seeing strange lights in the sky for about a month before this date and would brag to friends that i was seeing multiple UFO's at night and at various locations wherever i was at.  I told a friend one night that i bet we would see strange lights at his house and what we saw that night changed out life forever.  It started at 9pm and we saw 3 strange white non blinking lights that flew through the night sky in strange directions then would simply vanish.  We observed these lights a few more times then around 1am we said lets look one more time for the lights then go to sleep.  Here is where the report gets very interesting and the real UFO appears.  At first we didn't see anything and thought maybe we should just go to bed, then we all saw a bright flash of light to the West in the sky.   We all asked each other if we had seen the same thing and then it happened again, only this time the flash appeared in the sky illuminating some very high clouds that seemed to appear out of no where.  Then in awe all three of us experienced one more bright flash in the sky and then three bright white stationary lights appeared behind the flash!  This flash would illuminate the sky and were owing from this disk shaped UFO with three lights at the top not flashing, and had a red and white chasing light that would flicker across this UFO.  Now the whole time this is happening, nature around us is going crazy! the birds at night are never loud and this night when this event was happening, it sounded like over 1000 birds were squawking and making loud sounds.  None of us could talk as this UFo started to slowly hover towards us at about 100 meters in the sky while never making a sound itself.  This continued for about 15 minutes then it stopped and almost at the speed o! f light vanished in the sky without a sound.  All three of us ran in the house after this happened and couldn't sleep.  We know we saw something spectacular that night and remember it to the day.  Also a strange side event was that i called my girlfriend shortly after seeing this and she picked up the phone immediately.  She was crying about a very vivid nightmare she had about alien abduction!  Now I had not told her what i saw in the sky that night yet so it was a very weird coinsidence that she had a dream about aliens.  I don't know but everything that happened that night was so strange and makes me wonder what is really out there that we don't know about yet!\",\n",

I just looked over to the west and spotted want I thought was a really bright star and to be honest, didn’t think anything of it.  I just kept driving. I looked over again and it seemed to be much bigger and brighter.  As I watched it (as well as try to keep my eyes on the road, it started to get closer.  It was very low to the ground and seemed to be no more than a couple of hundred feet up. The bright light suddenly split into two lights (it probably was 2 lights all the time but as it was in the distance, looked like one).  I tried to see if I could make out any of the normal colored lights that all aircraft have on them but could not see any.  As it got closer, I realized it was big.. I could see smaller white light down the sides of it.  As I started to make out a shape (now take into account it was dark so as we know, eyes play tricks in the dark), I knew this was not a normal aircraft.. It was shaped like a boomerang with the two lights on the front end of it. I know that aircraft fitted with large landing lights have them on the wings just out from the main fuselage but it was not like this.  I couldn’t make out a nose cone or any kind of body behind the wing shape.  Ok, there are aircraft similar to this and I have seen them.  I grew up by a military aircraft manufacturing plant and have seen many many planes.  Regular design, alpha wing, reverse wing, old and new but this was not like any that I remember. As it got closer I realized that it was going to go almost right over the top of me and it did... well maybe just a little ahead because I watched it through my windscreen.  It was huge and like I say seemed to be really low to the ground... a couple of hundred feet at most.  When I say huge, I have seen and been really close and on a 747 and also a concord and it seemed to be bigger than this.  It was way too low to be just flying around and why have your landing lights on if you’re not landing because there is no airfield close enough for something that big to land around there except for Grissom and that is way south.  As it flew over me I was expecting a lot of noise but nothing... I tried to follow its path but as I took my eyes off it and pulled back my sun visor to the sun roof and be able to see it and then out of my side window..  It was gone..  I scanned around and nothing...  No lights, no shape, nothing. There were no other vehicles around, nothing in front except for one way of in the distance but I could not see anything behind me.  Crap... why is it always that way. I have no idea what it was.  Was it a plane that either I could not make out because it was dark but if so, why no coloured lights on it…  Or a strange design that I have not seen before...  Maybe it was Stealth tech because they are an odd shape.  A Vulcan bomber, they have the delta wing shape, or something else.  No I did not get abducted,  ((Passage deleted))  I have not had any strange antenna popping out of it.  What did I see, no idea so by definition it was a UFO.',\n",
       "       'Abduction and Oval Ufo sighting a few weeks before.  The aliens were red headed Lyrans About 3-4 weeks ago; above the wasatch mountains there was a oval white ship hovering about the mountains along the way of my walk. About a few weeks later Red headed Lyrans come to me in dream form and I was pulled through my ceiling, which has concrete on the roof, and I dont remember being pulled through the air. As I come aboard the ship, some of the aliens were curly haired strawberry red heads and some were tall; some were short. The key boards were all black with a big mouse looking orb on the thing where they control the ship. I asked them how they operated it and they bluntly refused to tell me how the ship worked. After that I saw an outside view of the ship and they told me they needed me for something while I remember them taking me to north dakota and seeing piles and piles of snow on the outside. When they shot up in the air the ship went from 100 feet above the ground to 40,000 feet about in a matter of a second. When I was also in the craft while abducted I asked them who the greys were and they told me a word which they said, \"They are your tan.\"  I looked up the root word and it means friend. They said that \"The Greys\" are humans friend. The abduction/dream lasted for about 5 hours.',\n",

       "       \"Two Star-like UFO's Seen in Denver During the Time of  the  2012 Summer Olympics in August. I was up late and watering the grass at the small apartment complex I live in.  I was facing east and across the street there is a parking lot.  In the northwest corner area of this lot there is a tall evergreen-like tree.  I just happened to look up at the sky in that direction as I often look at the sky when watering the grass at night. Positioned above the tip top of the evergreen tree I saw what looked like a large bright star.  It looked like just a typical star, white in color, but noticeably larger, like six stars together.  It was not physically over the tree, but its position in the sky was above the tip of the tree.  I must admit I go a little alarmed because I had heard about alien abductions.  I decided to communicate with it.  But I did this inaudibly.  I sent a thought/question to it and asked if it was from the Christ (meaning Jesus).  And, if so would it blink off and back on again. The star dimmed down, like it had a dimmer switch, until it was not visible and lit up again. I then asked if it was here for the rapture.  The star dimmed down again, but this time it dimmed down and lit up twice; and, the second lighting it appeared brighter than before. I need to add that sometime during this occurence, a young man was walking across the street going southbound and I asked him if he could see that huge star.  He said something inaudible and smiled/laughed and kept walking. As I kept watching the star, it started to slowly ascend upward.  As it was doing this, off to the right, another star (this one was like an ordinary star in size) started ascending upward and to the left, like at a 45 degree angle as if going toward the larger star. Both objects went upward and out of sight.  The ascension was not swift, but slow.\",\n",

       "       'Abduction experience I\\'ve been having dreams again and this is the most intense experience ever.  This may be a memory of an abduction (time and date unknown).  At first, they were a little disturbing, but now I believe that this may be a memory of event. I awoke, naked in a copper colored translucence room with rounded corners and indirect lighting.  A feminine (machine) voice spoke to me, answering my questions.  There was a rhythmic machine noise (or hum) in the distance and vibrations could be felt in the floor and walls of the craft. I believe the craft was quite large and that a form of artificial gravity was being used.  When I dropped objects they seemed to fall into their own footprint, not off center as would happen with centrifugal force generated gravity. The craft was large (I could only gauge its size from the rooms that I was allowed to traverse; hallways, hangars, corridors).  Perhaps as large as an American aircraft carrier. It appears to have been built for a humanoid form and the Air and climate was earth normal. All my communication was with the \"voice\" whom I knick-named \"Mother.\"  It wasn\\'t unpleasant. Recently the dreams have become more frequent and detailed.  I am retired Military and spent time at White Sands Missile Range where I witnessed a lot of UFO activity in the 1980\\'s.

       "       'Boomerang, V-shaped, craft with five bright lights as seen at Phoenix. ((NUFORC Note:  We are unable to certify that this is a serious-minded report.  PD)) KELOWNA, BRITISH COLUMBIA.   At 8:45 pm, I decided to go for a walk around the block for half hour to an hour.  I left my place and enjoyed a peaceful evening stroll.   I was walking through a dark alley that cut through two apt building ending up at a old school that is across the road from the high school which has several large football fields.   While in the alley heading home, I talked briefly too a group of guys who claimed to have seen a UFO in the sky and if I hurried over to the field I could still catch them.  He pointed me in the direction that they seen the UFO and said they have to leave.   I hurried over too the field and did not notice anything and thought for sure I had missed them, shortly after about a minute of observing the sky I observed some lights that seemed to come from nowhere, I saw five bright circular lights in the sky that were in a boomerang like V formation, the UFO was in the very bottom part of the cloud layer and the clouds around the UFO’s lights vanished all around for hundreds of feet.   I felt a feeling of fear and astonishment when I first seen the craft, the lights were in the east direction moving south climbing in altitude, I observed the lights as they began to get smaller, the light started to pulsate and grow brighter when the UFO disappeared in a streak of light much like what a shooting star looked like only the streak of light traveled into space instead of the ground.   I was still watching the sky and observed a light travel back from the direction in which it had shot away, the light was moving at super speeds because it traveled towards myself growing a bit brighter, the lights then slowed down and stayed stationary.   The sighting lasted for about ten minutes and occured just after 9 pm.  I could still make out the UFO when I left the school field.   I walked home very excited about what I had just observed and the first thing I was going to say to my room mate was if he wanted too come and take a look at a UFO in the sky near the high school, so I came upstairs gave his door a quick knock and entered his room.   I was instantly hit by a big gust of wind that made the curtains hit the roof and I almost blacked out, it felt like I had been drugged or was overcome by a deamonic dark presence,  I remember seeing a dark shadow creature come over me freezing me with fear. I thought  to myself oh my god I just had my room mate abducted and I went to the living room where I noticed that 20 minutes had elapsed in 40 seconds, I looked around the house for my room mate and finally found him outside when I told him the things that had just happened, he didn’t think it was crazy at all.  I was overcome by an energy and dreading feeling that I had too get out of the house, I thought for sure I was going to be abducted and I did not want to put anyone’s life in danger.   I left the house and walked for about an hour too a picnic table at a small creek that was still in the city but it was late and I barely observed a vehicle.   At this time I was starting to calm down and was beginning to accept what had recently happened to me, I was a little bit on edge because I jumped when something came out of the bushes, it turned out to be a dog that stopped to take a drink out of the creek and continued on his way.  It was starting to get late, approximately 1 am, I grabbed my backpack and was about to head to the road when I heard something in the bushes again and thought it was the dog having another drink at the creek so I walked down to the waters edge to see if I could pet him and make a friend, I was mistaken because I observed two short human like creatures, around 4&#8242; tall and a slender build, they had dark eyes that were larger then our own and no visible hair clothes to speak off. The creatures were dark In colour but not black, possibly a dark grey. I watched the ET’s run away from me running towards a carwash looking back at me for a glance, the one  jumped on top of a car with ease and ran over the top of it jumping down and continuing to follow the other  as they ran into the dark where I could not make them out.  I instantly thought” if they are running that way I am going this way” and I made my way to the brightly light highway that was nearby.  I was honestly scared of these things and all I wanted to do at this ! time was too feel safe.  I honestly don’t know what they were g! oing to do to me or why they ran away.  It has even crossed my mind that perhaps they were either coming to drink water from the creek or were stalking the stray dog that recently came from the path that the et’s were.   I accept now that we are not alone and am amazed at the fact that we have so many documented account of the same lights in the sky and the same creatures known as the Grey Aliens.',\n",
       "       'UFOs performing geometric patterns in the sky/Fireball/Possible alien encounter At the time that this incident happened in 1996, I did not know that any UFO reporting center existed, otherwise I would have reported this shortly after it happened. In the last couple of days (I\\'m writing this in November, 2014) I was listening to a podcast where Peter Davenport was interviewed; in the interview, Mr. Davenport encouraged anyone who had ever had a sighting at any time, no matter how much time had passed, to please write and submit their report.  That is why I am submitting this report at this time. I do believe that this incident was quite significant and should be documented. In 1996 I was 18 years old.  I grew up and had lived in the same house in rural Michigan my entire life at that time, my parents still live there to this day.  Our house was located on a small lake, it was and still is the only house on the lake.  There is a trail from our house around the lake which leads to a small public access area.  I knew this trail very well and I would often take walks around the lake. On this particular evening (unfortunately I don\\'t know the exact date, but I do remember that it was late spring of 1996, and for some reason I believe this happened on a Monday) I wasn\\'t tired and I decided to go for a walk around the lake.  I remember thinking about the fact that I was about to graduate high school and that soon I would be moving to Chicago for college.  I remember looking at the lake and the sky and thinking about the fact that I wouldn\\'t have access to this beautiful piece of land for very much longer and I was trying to absorb the location as much as possible.  I mention this only to try to give further verification that although this happened almost 20 years ago, I still remember very minute  details, even down to what I was thinking about at the time. I took the trail around the lake and although I carried a flashlight with me,  I didn\\'t turn it on as I knew the trail so well.  It was a very clear night and there was a moon in the sky which illuminated the area enough to where I could see quite well.  The trail to the primitive public access site was approximately 3/4 of a mile from our house.  Not surprisingly, I was the only person there at the time. I stood on the shore of the lake and looked up at the sky.  On a clear night, the stars are very bright in that area because there is no light pollution to diminish their radiance. I was looking north over the lake at the sky for several minutes when I noticed what I thought was a satellite moving across the sky slowly from east to west. There was nothing spectacular about this, it looked like a small, white, illuminated satellite light that I had seen countless times before, it emitted no sound at all. I thought at the time that this was a satellite because it was just a solid, slow moving white light with no blinking red or green lights that would indicate that it was an airplane. I watched this light move, really just because it was something to look at when, out of the corner of my eye I noticed another \"satellite\" moving from the exact opposite direction, from west to east at the same slow rate of speed, also emitting no sound. This seemed odd to me because, normally satellites only move in one direction, not two in opposite directions. As I watched these two objects slowly move across the sky and as they moved closer to each other, I realized that they were moving on exactly the same, but opposite course. As they moved closer to each other, it appeared that at some point they would either crash (I didn\\'t think that would happen) or they would totally eclipse each other to where, for a split second, it might appear that there was only one light. They got to where they were almost going to meet, then they both suddenly came to a complete stop very close to each other. Both objects were now almost directly overhead of my position, approximately at a 70 degree angle from my point of reference. I had never seen any moving object in the sky come to a complete stop, much less two of them, that\\'s when it happened. The first object shot slightly to the north, while the second object, in perfect synchronicity, shot directly to the south, they then turned and one suddenly moved east while the other moved west, then south,north, east, west etc... in opposite motions, making a perfect square pattern. It\\'s hard to judge the size of this \"square\" that they were making because although I do believe they were outside of the earth\\'s atmosphere (I\\'ll explain why later) I really have no idea how big they were, how far away they were, or how large this square pattern was. The only reference point I can give is if you were to take any two of the stars on Orion\\'s Belt as you stare at it from our vantage point on earth, and if you were to \"draw a line\" between these stars, you would have the approximate size of one of the \"sides\" of this square. The description of this square pattern is easier to convey in terms of a two dimensional surface like a chalk board rather then the three dimensional universe that we see. If you were to imagine two independently moving pieces of chalk on a chalk board representing the two flying lights, if one moved north or \"up\" the other moved south or \"down,\" one \"left\" the other \"right,\" over and over again and in such a fast rate of speed that it created a perfect geometric square with precise 90 degree angle turns. I watched these two lights making a perfect square pattern for about a minute or so. I couldn\\'t believe that I was actually witnessing this, so much so in fact that I literally didn\\'t believe my eyes. At this point I actually looked away to try to confirm that I wasn\\'t imagining the whole thing. I remember touching my tow into the water and watching the ripples emanate from my foot. I grabbed a piece of bark from the tree directly behind my, I smelled the bark and I took it and rubbed it briskly on my arm, I felt it scrape along my skin. I did this as sort of a \"systems check\" mostly just to confirm that I wasn\\'t dreaming and that I was in fact in complete control of my body and my senses. I then looked back up into the sky, the square pattern was still happening. At this point I became so overwhelmingly excited. I couldn\\'t believe what I was seeing but I knew I was seeing it. The two objects creating the square pattern were moving so fast and it was mesmerizing. I began to feel, actually to realize, that this was something that was happening for my benefit, or at the very least for my entertainment. I knew at that moment that I was as aware of \"them\" as they were of me. I can\\'t quite describe how I knew that they were aware of me other than that I just knew that they were. It\\'s sort of like if you were to look across a crowded room and make eye contact with a random and complete stranger, your eyes meet and then you both smile or perhaps even wave at each other, you don\\'t need to be telepathic to know that you are both aware of each other; that\\'s how this moment felt. I have since wondered if there was something telepathic going on there and I can\\'t honestly say for sure. All I can say is that I know I was aware of a living presence and it felt overwhelmingly positive. It could simply be that this was the most amazing thing I\\'ve ever seen before (or since) and I felt so fortunate to be seeing it. I didn\\'t feel that there was any underlying message being given to me other than at least two very advanced beings, with capability beyond anything humans could create just wanted to say, \"hi, we\\'re here and look how cool this is!\" I remember smiling from ear to ear. This went on for at least four or five more minutes. It went on for so long in fact that I remember thinking that no one would believe this, I wished that I had a way to bring everyone I knew into this situation, or to somehow document it with a camera, but unfortunately I couldn\\'t do that, so the only thing I could do would be to enjoy it and to remember every detail as best I could. After what felt like a very long time (again, I\\'d say four or five minutes, it felt so long that I began to wonder when it would end) the two objects then stopped and rested in the same position where they first came to a stop in the sky originally. Then, just as they came in, they both departed at the same slow rate of speed that they first emerged, but in opposite directions. One object departed towards the east, the other towards the west. As they moved farther apart, suddenly the object moving to the west seemed to emit something, a gigantic fireball. This looked like a meteor entering our atmosphere (this is why I believe these objects were just outside of our atmosphere) but probably ten times the size of any \"shooting star\" that I had ever seen. It took up an enormous part of the sky, it was larger than almost any Fourth of July firework that I\\'d ever seen. It dropped out of the sky and appeared to come almost straight down across the lake to the north. It was a brilliant flash of light that lasted for only a second or so but it was so big and so bright that it made me yell out with excitement. I didn\\'t see any object dropping other than the fireball itself and I have no idea if it \"landed,\" burned up in the atmosphere, traveled for miles or just came straight down. Like the other two objects, the fireball made no noise. The object that appeared to emit it, as well as the other object, ! continued on their course until they were out of range. I was left standing there trying to comprehend what I had just witnessed. I began walking back around the lake, my mind reeling with what I had just experienced. I had walked about 1/4 of a mile and was just on the other side of the lake from where I had seen everything, still about 1/2 a mile from home, when I began to hear something. I sometimes hesitate to tell this part of the story, because I honestly have no idea if this is at all related to what I had just witnessed, but in the interest of full disclosure, I feel it is important to document this. Something in the woods just behind me and over my left shoulder, began moving and walking towards me, I didn\\'t see it, but I could hear it. It is important to remember that I had grown up in these woods and that I was very familiar with the sounds that animals make. If I hear a bluejay, I don\\'t need to see it to know it\\'s there, the same with the scampering sound of a squirrel, the waddling of a raccoon, the soft step and startled \"snort\" of a deer etc... The sound that I was hearing was unmistakably the sound of footsteps on the leaves. The footsteps approaching directly behind me and over my left shoulder. The only sound that I can compare this to is the somewhat heavy, bipedal sound of human footsteps, in a very rhythmic, \"crunch, crunch, crunch,\" pattern. It sounded distant at first but it slowly began moving closer. Very few animals move around at night, unless perhaps they are injured or sick. Nocturnal ground animals like racoons don\\'t sound anything like this. There are no bears or wolves in that area that I\\'ve ever seen, and although I\\'ve heard many animals walking through the woods,! I\\'ve never once had one follow me. Obviously this was terrifying, especially considering what I had just seen. I got to a fork in the trail where I stayed to the left to get home. After taking this part of the trail, this thing was still following me and moving closer. I stopped. It took a few more steps then stopped. I started walking again and it started walking again. It slowly kept getting closer. My heart was beating through my chest at this point and my mind was racing, not just because I didn\\'t know what this was but also because of everything that had happened to me so recently. I remember being very scared, by now I would estimate that whatever this was had to be about 15 feet or less away from me. Scared or not, I needed to know what this was. I wasn\\'t going to walk the entire way home with something following me, and the idea of running away from it actually seemed worse because for all I knew, it might start chasing me. I stopped again. I turned on my flashlight. I quickly spun around and ran as fast as I could in the direction that I could hear this thing. My adrenaline was working overtime and as I started to sprint. I think I heard the sound of  leaves scattering, but I can\\'t say for certain as the sound of my own feet were now the loudest thing in the area. As fast as this happened, I didn\\'t see anything. I ran off the trail and into the woods, my flashlight now brightening the woods. Branches were whipping across my face but I didn\\'t care, I needed to see what this was. I zigzagged back and forth, back onto the trail and off again looking on the ground, into the trees, everywhere that I could see, but I saw nothing. If this were an animal, you\\'d think I would have seen a tail, or legs, or something scampering up a tree, but I saw nothing. To this day I have no idea what that was. For all I know this could have been an animal behaving strangely that got away from me very quickly, perhap! s it was something else entirely, I really can\\'t say for sure. I don\\'t exactly remember what happened after that. I\\'m quite sure I remember walking home along the trail and going up into my room and directly to bed, but this now feels like a distant memory. I sincerely regret not writing this down immediately after it happened, or at the very least taking note of the time and date that it occurred, but I guess I just assumed that I would remember all of those details forever. Obviously I know now that is not the case. The only other strange thing about this story is that I really have no memory of telling anyone about this until years after it happened.  I have a great relationship with my parents and I\\'m sure I must have told them, my high school girlfriend or any of my other friends, but I don\\'t remember doing that.  I remember telling one of my roommates this story about six or seven years later.  I remember when I told him that I had already told some other people about it but I really didn\\'t think about it that much since that night.  To this day, even when I try to talk to someone like my parents, who know that I wouldn\\'t make something like this up, they believe that I saw something, but they definitley don\\'t believe the details that I absolutely know are true.  I used to get very angry when I told people this story and they didn\\'t believe me. I\\'ve received a lot of ridicule from other people who trust me and are very close to me as well; perhaps that\\'s why I didn\\'t and still don\\'t tell! this story very often. Probably because of this incident, I\\'ve become very intrigued with Ufology over the years. I\\'ve read many books and watched many videos. I\\'ve of coursed wondered if I may have been abducted that night, but after revisiting this incident many, many times and given it much objectionable thought, I really don\\'t believe that I was. As I\\'ve stated, aside from that brief scare in the woods, this was an overwhelmingly positive experience for me. Over the years I\\'ve learned not to get angry about the fact that it seems like only a small handful of people take this story at face value, basically that it happened and I don\\'t really know much more than that. I\\'ve accepted the fact that many people don\\'t know how to deal with something like this, and also that I have no idea who or what this really was, where they came from or why I got to see this when so few other people haven\\'t had an experience like this. What I\\'ve learned to take away from this over the years is that I\\'m extremely grateful that it happened. Aside from the few terrifying moments in the woods, this was an overwhelmingly positive experience, filled with wonder and hope that there is something greater than us. I have no idea if these things are from other planets, other dimensions or perhaps right here on earth from something other than human origins. All I know for certain as that this happened and I was fortunate enough to be in the right time and in the right place to experience it. For that I am grateful. Thank you very much for all of your tireless efforts into this field of collecting data and for providing a place to submit this report like this.',\n",
       "       'Round probe which appeared to be emiting sparks. Yesterday (September 9, 2014) I was watching a bunch of UFO shows on direct TV and they mentioned your organization.  Up to this point I did not know there was a place to report UFO sightings. My wife and I lived in Manitou Beach, Michigan between June 1998 and July 2002.  I believe it was the fall of 1998 when I had an experience with an unidentified flying object.   I drove from my house on Devils Lake Hwy to Brooklyn, Michigan, in the evening to pick up some Chinese food for supper.  Returning home, I drove south out of Brooklyn and drove down Brooklyn Rd., which runs next to MIS (Michigan International Speedway).  When I arrived at the corner of Brooklyn Road and US12 I saw an object in the night sky which appeared to be approximately above Round Lake Highway.   I pulled off the road at the corner and sat in my car watching the object.  The object appeared to be the size of a basketball, it changed colors from yellow, to orange, to blue on the perimeter and appeared to be emitting sparks.  The object moved extremely slow and ran parallel to US 12, moving from the west to the east, and the object was approximately 100 feet above the tree line.  I watched this object for approximately 15 minutes and it maintained the same height, never changing its altitude. I served in the United States Navy and US Army National Guard.  The object had characteristics of a flare with some notable differences.  Flares do not maintain their altitude and fall to the ground diagonally unless there is a strong wind - and there was no wind.   I thought about a meteor but the item moved much to slow.  I tried to put a rational explanation as to what I was seeing in the night sky but came up empty.   At this point, I had worked for the Michigan Department of Corrections in Parole/Probation for over 10 years, and believe I’m a confident observer.  I watched the item from the time it was over Round Lake Highway until it had moved on its easterly course until it had probable passed over M50, at which time I decided to head for home, but the object continued on an easterly course at the same height and continued to follow US 12. The though crossed my mind that I was witnessing an Unidentified Flying Object, which alarmed me to some degree, but I thought the item was small to be a flying saucer and, unless they have a shrink ray, there would be no way for the object to abduct me or beam me aboard.   I thought the object might be a probe, but the only significant land mark in the area is Michigan International Speedway.  I should also note there are no military installations in the area and there was no events taking place at Michigan International Speedway, so there was no reasons for a flare to be in the night sky.   I’m extremely confident that what I saw was not a flare of any type and that’s why I’m writing to you to report an unidentified flying object.  If we had cell phones with cameras back then, I would have loved to have taken a photograph of the object because it was really interesting.  This is the first time I’ve told anyone of the incident with the exception of my wife and kids. Throughout the shows that I watched I did not see any reports of UFO’s matching the description of the item that I saw but found the vast array and variety of spacecraft reported which makes me wonder if we’re not being visited by various entities, and then that brings up the logical question - why?  DNA samples, intelligence gathering, mapping, scientific studies by entities visiting our planet lead me to the question of intention.  While I was in the National Guard I served as an intelligence analyst for awhile and it was my job to evaluate potential threats and create counter measures.  Time after time I have seen on the shows about UFO’s visiting earth where the spacecraft have been around military installations and other vital infrastructure around the world.  Often we hear a comparison between technological differences and how earthlings are new to the cosmic scope and how entities visiting earth are so much more advanced - but then there are reports of so many cra! shed space ships.  Even in our infancy we have gps, collision alarms for aircraft (and cars now), and a host of other technological devices - so it seems rational to believe any advanced entity would also have these items so I’m not sure why there would be so many crashed spaceships. In closing:  I believe in what I see with my own eyes.  I cannot put a rational explanation to what I saw (which does not mean there is not a rational explanation).  Even if I had not experienced an unidentified flying object I believe there is life beyond earth just as a matter of chance - as a gambler you play the odds and if you look into the heavens you would have to be ignorant to believe we are alone.  I think it is shameful UFO sighting are not taken seriously by governments around the world because as an intelligence analyst you need data in order to reach conclusions and to come up with logical responses.  I graduated from Western Michigan University with a double major - Criminal Justice/Sociology, which means I like to collect evidence, look at it and draw my own conclusions.  I also like to study people and societies and cannot help but wonder why some societies seem to have more experiences with other entities then others and wonder what significance this ph! enomenon has in the larger picture. I thank you for your time and attention.',\n",

What was that...I need one of  those so I can ride you on it over the freeway too so we don't have to wait it traffic… I thought for sure it was a something new that was used to transport faster a above traffic to get to an accident or emergency or respond to a child abduction or something serious…\",\n",
       "       'Giant levitating triangle followed our car with four people inside from Stone Cliff to Oak Hill. I was taking an evening drive with my sister and our two friends.  Around 6:00 pm we drove to Thurmond to look at the stars and watch the night sky, which was clear at this time.  We stopped the car and got out at the Stone Cliff sand bar.  We sat and watched the sky for around 30 minutes before we noticed a very bright, bouncing light up on the ridge line across the river.  Then we noticed there was two other dimmer lights that moved as a unit with the bright light, this is how we realized it was triangular.  The lights on the craft became very dim at times, but then they would brighten. We got in the car and drove up on the bridge at Stone Cliff to get a better view.  This is when we noticed the craft stayed parallel and kept up with us as we drove, though it was still across the river and hovering up over the ridge line relatively far away from us.  It moved  and rotated very quickly, faster than any plane, helicopter, or satellite and it was also very large, but completely silent.  We drove toward Thurmond near the ranger station and pulled over again, and this is when we noticed the craft crossing the river and hovering toward us.  The triangular shape became larger as it neared us, it hovered over the tree line and stayed behind us.  We were fearful at this point and began driving back toward Oak Hill.  The craft followed the road, hovering above the tree and ridge line, while maintaining a close distance to our car.  At one point the giant, levitating triangle was directly above us. On the drive home from Thurmond we pulled over several times (at Red Star and Hilltop) and got out of the vehicle in order to view the triangle.  The craft stayed within our vicinity most of the drive back to town, but I lost sight for a short time.  I regained sight of the craft when we came to the intersection at Route 19, because I saw it hovering far above the road, and the lights on the craft seemed to be bouncing again.  As we neared the lights of Oak Hill I lost sight of the triangle once more, but when we arrived at my house the craft had followed us there.  The triangle was closer to the surface of the earth than it had been before, hovering above the tree line. We stood on my drive way and I showed my mother and other friend the craft.  The time was around 8:00 or 8:30 pm at this time and clouds had began moving in and the craft had become very dim.  The craft moved to a clearing in the clouds above my house, at this time my friend had no trouble viewing the craft, as its lights had become bright again. All witnesses agree that we saw an extraordinary levitating triangle in the sky, though it was clearer and brighter at times.  Only 4 of us witnessed the triangle at Stone Cliff, but 6 people (that I know of) saw the triangle when it was in Oak Hill.  The whole sighting lasted around 2 hours, most of the viewing at Stone Cliff and Thurmond, but it hovered over our neighborhood for a quite awhile (until we lost sight due to cloud coverage).  I know this is an incredibly long UFO sighting, and strange because the triangle noticed and followed us.  I believe it could have easily abducted us if had it wanted to, but the triangle only observed us without interaction.

       "       \"A hovering orange light 300 feet in the air that took off at incredible speed. UFO Sighting near Bowmanville, ON, Friday, August 15, 2014.   I was driving towards Bowmanville, along Hwy 2, at 10:25 pm, to pick up my wife from work.  I was talking on the phone (speaker) with a friend, when I told him I saw a strange light hovering to the NE of me, near Holt Rd.  I told him I thought it was a UFO, and it looked like the top of a tower, even though I knew there was no tower there.  It was about 300 ft up.  About 10 other cars would have seen this too.  I spotted it right after I passed Rundle Rd.. I kept my eye on it and could tell I was getting closer and closer to it.  I could tell it was right over Holt Rd., as I was now just beside it.  I knew if I turned north on Holt, I could get out to see it, as I was now basically right below it.   I was still talking to my friend and told him not to hang up.  I found a place to park just north of the group mail boxes right across from Bob's towing, a junk yard and a car dealership.  From the time I turned at the traffic lights to park there, took approx. 10 seconds.   I got out and immediately looked up, but the object had just flown off in an easterly direction towards Bowmanville (3 kms away).  I could see it moving away and then out of sight.  To have moved that fast from Holt Rd to over Bowmanville would require a speed of 300 kms per hr I am guessing.  I have yet to do the math.  I had no time to use my phone to get a photo.  I would have if it had not taken off.  If I had had a gun I would have shot it down just so I could prove what i! t was.  I may never know. At first I was hoping it was a Chinese lantern as it would explain things.  I had seen these lit and flown, last year at my sister's wedding.  But of course they don't sit stationary in one spot and then dart off at unimaginable speeds.  The object was round and a fiery orange colour that glowed and I was close enough that I could actually see the glow shimmering.  Because it would have appeared as the light on top of a tower, I am judging that it was 300 feet up, and that it was from between 5-20 feet in diameter.  There is no way it was more than 600 feet up.  There was no sound that I could hear either.  This is the typical type of sighting that others have reported since the 1960s. A friend thought it might have been a drone.  My questions are: do drones hover?  Do they look circular and fiery orange at night?  And can they travel at phenomenal speeds?   I am not a believer in paranormal events like ghosts or alien abductions, but I know what I experienced and I will label it as a UFO.  My family and I also saw one back in around 1980 at Gravenhurst, ON, but that one has already been reported.\",\n",

As I assessed what was happening I tried to scream but had no voice.  At that moment the figure at the base of my bed that was approximatly 3 and a half feet tall with a hood and helmet like face cover with no seems or colour to his uniform began to fade and become translucent then disappeared.

       "       'Lighted craft hovered for 3-minutes, then dove 1-mile in 5-seconds This is the second of two consecutive reports about my sightings of December 11, 2013 and June 13, 2014, at age 73 and 74, respectively.  I observed my first and only two UFOs ever.   Both of these sightings occurred within a 6-month period from the same general location.  Since these objects appeared to be about the same size and shape, I have the impression that both sightings might have been of the same craft; however, I have no other proof of this assumption.  These are given in chronological order, and the first sighting in 2013 was vague, distant and impersonal – I did not file a report on it then, nor even mention it to anyone, including my wife.  By contrast, the second encounter in 2014 was a life-changing event – it was shocking to be shown that we humans are not the only intelligent beings here. My second, very much unexpected and extremely more vivid sighting occurred six months later at 11:00 pm on Friday night, June 13, 2014, near Hexter Elementary School.  I had walked to Gold’s Gym at Northcliff & Buckner at 9:30 pm and had left at 10:50 pm.  It was a beautiful night, comfortably warm, the sky was clear with a full moon and no wind, and there was not the usual city noise.  Nobody else was seen outside and there was no automobile traffic in the neighborhood.  I was walking alone in the middle of the street in the full moonlight. As I was traveling roundabout back to my house, a lighted craft suddenly appeared high over me at Northlake near Peavy.  I was rounding a curve heading generally northward and the lights cleared above the 30-foot trees to my right, or east side.  This occurred within the usual flight path of airplanes originating from south Texas and landing at Love Field; however, at this time most scheduled Southwest Airline flights had finished for the night – which seemed to be a very important factor in the presence of this thing.   Before 10:00 pm, mostly 737s and some corporate jets fly over here at about 8,000-feet or 1.5-mile altitude, heading north to cross I-635 where they will make a left, west to south U-turn and land at Love Field.  Now, there were not any planes in the sky anywhere.  Subconsciously, I assumed the lights were an airplane, but the object actually stopped directly above me as I was walking alone in the middle of the street.   I instantly looked up and felt that it had be! en watching me on the roadway in the full moonlight – I was the only rabbit alone on the road.  The craft appeared to be positioned almost 1-mile straight up – maybe 1 or 2-degrees eastward – with the apparent size of a large corporate jet; it seemed to be slightly smaller than a 737.  Although it is difficult to estimate size and height at night, I am reasonably sure that it was not over 1-mile, nor under 1/2-mile. (I have since studied airplanes flying directly overhead to confirm this perceived altitude and size.) -See illustration of UFO provided - It had extremely bright lights of pure colors, the brightest I have ever seen and the most beautiful red and green. There was no softness to the lights, only a sharp piercing glare.   The object had a strange jerky aspect unlike any aircraft.  No Federal Aviation Administration navigation lights were apparent – specifically, green on the starboard, red on the port, flashing strobes on the wingtips, with fore and aft white lights as required below 10,000 feet altitude.  Its lights were arranged in a nonsensical pattern as in my diagram above, with the red lights blinking on and off every 2-seconds – this appeared to be the front, as the craft moved.  All of the red lights pulsed together; there was no 1-2-3 sequence.  The green lights shined steady, did not blink and appeared to be the sides.   Each red and green row was composed of about 10 individual pinpoint lights, all like bulbs with equal intensity. No other lights, colors or emanations could be seen.  My sketch diagrams the bel! ly of the craft as seen from below.  The body was not visible as a silhouette against the sky because of the bright lights; however, I am certain that there was a rigid structure because the lights maintained their relative position at all times.  If I were to guess, I would say the object was rather triangular because of the arrangement of the lights, but I cannot be sure of this.  It had a clear-cut, garish carnival midway appearance – there was no vagueness at all.  My initial and vivid impression was as if a Texas State Fairground contraption, such as a Ferris wheel, with its colorful, blinking lights, had been placed 1-mile overhead in the night sky to float around –  it was totally out of place and illogical.  I instantly realized that this was not an airplane, so I quickly stepped under a front yard tree to my right or east side on Northlake, to hide from its view.  My actions were largely reflexive and fear-responsive, so I probably was only visible to the craft for a few! seconds. Immediately after I hid, the object seemed to have lost me, because it began to go back and forth, do figure-8s, hover and rock as I watched from between the leaves. Imagine that you are standing on the bottom of a lake watching the bottom of a big motorboat circling above you on the surface; similarly, seen by me from below, the circling craft acted as though it was floating on a flat horizontal surface.  The effect was like looking up at the bottom of a large launch that was being driven around on a choppy lake surface; perhaps the medium or force upon which the craft rode – or it created – was wavy.  The craft stayed contained within an imaginary circle of about 1/4-mile diameter eastward of me as it apparently searched; it never strayed to the west side of me.  Of course, its actions were faster than a motorboat as it maneuvered around searching the bottom below.  When it stopped, it seemed to rock like a boat, as though floating on waves.  The craft appeared to be driven or controlled by a coxswain who was methodically searching the bottom below, making its movements selective, erratic and chaotic as it went back and forth, repeatedly, stopping and going. The object emitted a very faint but perceptible whirring sound from high up, similar to an electric motor brush.  This sound had that same distant overhead audio quality as some hot air balloons, ultra-lights and blimps that I have heard from the ground while they were high above me; I have heard voices, burners and motors from these.  With this UFO, I had both eyed and eared confirmation of an actual materially structured mechanical craft and of its apparent vertical distance above.  Furthermore, the tone or pitch of the electrical motor sound seemed to change throughout its movements overhead, as though accommodating various mechanical requirements. Throughout all of this, I was busily playing devil’s advocate – “Could this be an electrically powered human-fabricated aircraft?”  Suddenly, I realized that if whatever was controlling this thing had infrared vision that I had better get behind the wooden tree limbs, which I promptly did.  For whatever reason, the object appeared to be searching for ground-based subject matter, so I remained cowing against the tree trunk and became a certified tree-hugger.  To add to my problems, the front yard’s motion detector light turned on. This weirdness went on for the longest three minutes, my anxiety level was rising and I began to wonder how it would all play out.  Suddenly, without any warning, the object instantly streaked nose-first at a downward angle, around 45-degrees, east-northeast toward the Lochwood Park area. It went from hovering almost directly overhead, down to the horizon, traveling over a 1-mile distance, at one constant and terrific speed. There was no observable acceleration against inertia or deceleration against momentum. I have watched high-performance jets stall out several miles above and then rev up to flight speed – this takes several seconds. My UFO did this instantly! When its lights disappeared through the trees and just above the horizon, it was still travelling at the same speed without slowing down. Its observed lack of inertia and momentum implied that the object had no mass, as though it were only a mirage or light image, and it actually looked somewhat that way during the d! ive. Although I could only see the lights, the craft appeared to be intermittent between a real object such as a bus or airplane, and an artificial movie-projected image of such. That is, at times, it would have passed for a solid material night-flying helicopter; while at other times, the lights seemed transparent and unreal, like projections on a movie screen. The greatest division in this dichotomy appeared between the very separate hovering and diving phases. During the overhead circling, I felt as though I could rap my knuckles on the craft; conversely, during the dive, I felt as though my arm might go through it. This division was reinforced by the whirring mechanical sound of the craft as it hovered, contrasted by the total silence when it dived at supersonic speed. Lending to this impression, a solid form would have created friction, pushed the air aside and made a horrific noise; this thing made no sound whatsoever. There was no noise at all during the dive – any air-dis! placement whoosh, sonic boom, crash or explosion – anything! Artillery shells make a distinctive sound as they pass through the air, and this speeding UFO should have done likewise. Incredibly, there appeared to be no resistance from the air. I felt that if I had shot this thing with a rifle, the bullet would have gone through it. Because of the lack of both inertia and air resistance, I must assume that there was no solid object – AS WE KNOW IT – during the dive phase. This raises my question of whether the UFO was somehow outside of our physical reality, a consideration that might apply to the origin of these things. I assume that a craft from another solar planet or star system would obey the same Newtonian physical laws that we do – but this thing did not do this. - See diagram of flight path provided - Visualize a right triangle with me on the ground at the 90-degree angle, and the craft 1-mile above me, searching within a 1/4-mile diameter circle to the east.  The full Moon is southeast, at about 50-degrees elevation at 11:00-pm CDT, at its lowest zenith in June – exactly opposite the Sun. The UFO dove toward the east-northeast at about a 45-degree angle. I have fine-tuned the compass direction with several visits; however, because it dived away from me, the exact descent angle cannot be exact.  Therefore, I have bracketed or averaged it as 45-degrees, and the ‘landing point’ would be approximately 1-mile away horizontally at the other 45-degree angle.  On the map, that would be around the Lochwood Park area.  Draw a line from Northlake-Peavy east-northeast across Lochwood Park and somewhere along this track is where the UFO ‘landed.’  By geometry, the flight path or hypotenuse would be about 1 1/4-mile long – or a little over 1-mile when discounting the 10-degree roofline.  The object’s closest proximity to me would be about 7/10-mile as it slid down the hypotenuse.  I watched its lights through the trees until the craft was about to slam into the ground about 1/10-mile above the actual horizon.  Seeing the UFO dive to the horizon greatly helped me to scale and confirm my original vertical estimate as about 1-mile altitude, and no lower than 1/2-mile. I have used three methods to determine and confirm the exit speed as about Mach-1.  First, my daughter and I have attended the Fort Worth Alliance air show annually for over twenty years – a father-daughter thing.  There are always jet interceptor fly-bys, usually by an F-18 Super Hornet, at Mach-1, whereby the sound shock wave is visible forming off the fuselage.  The June 13 UFO simply appeared to be diving that fast and that is what I settled on. Second, it took no more than 5-seconds for the craft to go from 1-mile overhead, then 45-degrees downward to the horizon, a dive distance of over 1-mile.  Here, I estimated the dive time, based upon my gut feel of 5-seconds.  Third, at home I pointed my finger at an imaginary UFO and had my daughter time my downward sweep with a watch, always getting about 5-seconds.  In summary, 1-mile multiplied times 5-seconds works out to 720-mph, or about Mach-1. At the short end of the spectrum, time is easy to estimate. Two, five and ten-seconds can be accurately guessed.  As time gets longer, estimating becomes more inaccurate – one minute is more difficult and an hour is even more so.  Five-seconds were easy to guess and to confirm by dragging my hand downward and having someone else clocks me.  My object had lights that pulsed every two seconds and it dove within about five seconds – these times were simple to bracket and measure.  I estimated that the craft hovered above me for 3-minutes because it seemed like 3-minutes, even when considering the lengthened anxiety factor.  In addition, I bracketed the hovering phase – it was certainly longer than 1-minute and probably shorter than 5-minutes – thus, 3-minutes.  My calculations of distance, time and speed all conform to one another mathematically – its red lights blinked every two seconds, the object hovered about 1-mile above for 3-minutes and exited at a 45-degree downward angle, di! ving within about 5-seconds at a speed of around 720-mph. As the craft streaked downward toward the horizon, its lights were visible through the nearby trees, but of course, the lights were blocked when they went behind the roofline.  The angle of total disappearance was about 5 or 10-degrees above the actual horizon, which would have been about 1/10-mile above the ground at the ‘point of impact.’  Seeing the object go through the far tree line greatly reinforced my vertical estimate as 1-mile distance.  The UFO’s path of descent formed an imaginary ‘hypotenuse of a right triangle,’ which is depicted in the third diagram.  At the horizontal, its size and distance could be compared to foreground features – much as a rising full moon can be compared to nearby hills, trees, houses and so forth – this confirmed my estimation of the overall scale of the UFO flight path. The contrast between the 3-minute hovering and the 5-second dive was astounding, and suggested that there were two methods of control during these two phases – manual and autopilot.  This dichotomy erased all doubt as to whether or not this was a human construction.  The circling and wobbling object appeared to be silly, jerky, and almost Warner Brothers cartoonish with the super bright garish lights – the reds pulsing on and off, and the greens glowing steadily.  The searching was asymmetrical, irregular and chaotic – as though a coxswain was steering the boat randomly and impulsively as he searched the ground far below.  If I had witnessed only the hovering phase, I would not be convinced that it was not some type of human-made aircraft. By contrast, had I seen only the 5-second dive, I would not be convinced that it was not some reentering satellite debris.  This exit plunge was straight, steady, mechanical, meteor-like and almost blurred.  Unlike in its erratic circling phase, the fast diving craft did not appear to be arbitrarily piloted, but went down uniformly at a constant speed in a straight line from A to B as though programmed and automatic.  It appeared as if a switch was flipped, which said, “Take me from here to there.”  Certainly, no human pilot would have had nerve reflexes fast enough to control this suicide dash downward and I assume the same for any biological organism.  As it dove, the form or basic structure of the object was perfectly retained – the blinking red bar of lights in front and the two steady green rows of lights on the sides. However, more so than when it was circling, the craft looked strangely like an artificial light image as it dashed downward, with the pulsing red lights at th! e front. Possibly, the angle of the lights were turned away from me somewhat, making them appear dimmer, thus contributing to the dichotomy of appearance. The object went down angled into the dive and all of its light structure was retained intact, as though it being a rigid object. However, both of these phases, when put together said that this was not grandma’s biscuits. I looked straight at this thing for 3-minutes as it hovered, and for 5-seconds as it dove – it definitely was NOT a human-made aircraft! A saying goes that we should always look for ponies before we look for unicorns. In the best tradition of looking for ponies, immediately following the sighting I attempted to eliminate all plausible possibilities. I considered a DRONE as an explanation, and several other folks, including my wife, have since offered the drone scenario (which seems to be the contemporary Debunker explanation for all UFOs today). This would certainly fit the hovering and whirring electric motor sound, since several drone models are electric powered hovering devices. Immediately after this event, I asked myself, “Did someone launch and retrieve a drone from the Lochwood Mall parking lot?” However, I quickly dismissed my devil’s advocacy here because this explanation would have been more unrealistic than a ‘flying saucer.’ The large size, mile altitude, glaring lights and exit speed ruled against a drone. Hobbyist’s electric RC craft are small, weak and slow, and they fly at very low altitudes. ! Military drones are larger and more powerful, but still rather slow. These are secretive, conserve power to remain on patrol for long periods, and they do not waste batteries on bright lighting; the CIA is not going to advertise its presence with glaring, blinking lights. All of this goes against the large corporate jet-size of my UFO, which was hovering 1-mile up with lights blazing while milling back and forth. Consider the Mach-1 exit speed. No drone, civilian or military, is streamlined or powerful; indeed, such a design would be antithetical to the hovering purpose of a drone. All drones have propellers or rotors. No propeller driven airplane has ever achieved Mach speed and survived – ever!  This formidable velocity requires an aerodynamic, reinforced coke bottle-shaped fuselage, sweptback razor thin wings, and a turbojet engine with a powerful afterburner.  Even the fabled F-86 Saber Jet and MiG 15 of Korean War vintage could not reach the speed of sound.  Moreover, no human-constructed aircraft – prop or jet – would have pulled out of such a steep dive at that speed. Finally, yet importantly, all aircraft, civilian and military, CIA or FBI, drone or whatever, flying high in United States commercial airspace are required by law to conform to FAA lighting standards.  This is to prevent mid-air collisions with other planes.  As ruled by the National Transportation Safety Board, an ‘aircraft’ is any device used for flight in the air – there are no exceptions!  My observed object was violating a main landing flight path over northeast Dallas, which would have been filled with vulnerable commercial Love Field traffic an hour earlier.  It was shining and blinking bright garish lights that were arranged in the bizarre pattern illustrated above, that made no sense and which conformed to no codes or regulations.  If it were any human-made object, it would have been flying illegally and in violation of United States law. My UFO had a definite symmetrical structure, differential lighting, a variable mechanical sound, a 3-minute time of operation and a complex behavior, so it was not a natural phenomenon such as a mirage, ball lightning, plasma, Venus, meteor, swamp gas and so forth. It moved back and forth against the wind, so it was not a passive lighter-than-air object such as a balloon, kite or Chinese lantern. During its high-speed dive, the UFO exhibited no inertia or momentum, and it made no sound; therefore, it was not a human-made aircraft – no human construct can do this. All of this taken together leaves only a NOT human solution. Of interest, the June 13 object appeared to be predatory by its raptor-like tactics. First, there was the sneaking up and hovering above me. Second, after I hid under a tree whereby it lost me, the craft started to circle as though scanning the ground for a replacement. Third, it seemed to have spotted another ground-based subject, toward which it made a dive. (Of course, we want to believe this target was an abductee – whether true or not.) The entire affair was reminiscent of a hawk circling in the sky and stooping at a mouse in a field. I suspect, but will never know, that my quick reflexive hiding may have saved me from being confronted by whatever was operating this thing. It was never closer than 7/10-mile during the 5-second diving. Other than the expected natural anxiety and elevated adrenaline, I have never experienced any unusual symptoms then or afterwards. I actually arrived home earlier than planned because I did not proceed with my exercise walkabout, thus had ! no ‘missing time.’ Several months later, I have not experienced any side effects, so I guess that I am in the clear… The weirdly blinking red and the stationary green lights made no sense; were they designed for them or for us? I have reviewed many other UFO reports and have never seen any pattern described like mine; therefore, I assume it was either a custom job or the object could configure its own lighting scheme.  All that I can surmise is that the garish, colorful lights might have been an enticement or gimmick to instill interest and attract a sucker to stand still and gawk. I know that I certainly was enticed to observe this thing; only my fear of the unknown overrode my curiosity and kept me from standing in the open street and observing it.  This entire affair became a delicate balance between me hiding from the craft and me peeking at it. Of note, the UFO did not execute whatever action it desired, against whatever ground-based target it apparently had – from high up during its hovering position.  There were no visible projectiles, rays or whatever extending downward from the object toward any ground subject; conversely, there was nothing from the ground, which came upward to the craft.  Apparently, the object had to dive physically from its mile-high perch down to whatever it had targeted at ground level.  It appeared to have needed to get near whatever its interest was to accomplish whatever it wanted to do.  This would be like a hawk needing to get down grasping a mouse with its talons.  I estimate that the UFO ‘landed’ somewhere along a straight path, east-northeast from Northlake-Peavy, with Lochwood Park as the central impact.  It was traveling at a constant Mach-1 velocity as it approached about 1/10-mile above the ground.  I did not see it again as I walked home after that, so the object either stopped instantly or else it drilled into the ground.  Afterwards, there was no explosion, no news report and no evidence of damage. Two days after my June 13 observation, I wrote a short letter to the Dallas Morning News in hopes that other witnesses, perhaps near Lochwood Park, had seen where the object went and what it did after plunging below the tree line.  My letter was not published, which suggests that when these things are reported to the mainstream news media, they are laughed off.   Circuitously, since no one hears about them, there is nothing to them!  During my lifetime of 74-years, I have never seen anything that I could not explain; I can even explain my two Unidentified Flying Objects and thus make them Identified Flying Objects – they simply are highly advanced machines, designed, built and operated in our atmosphere by intelligent creatures that are NOT human.  What these beings are or where they are from, I can only speculate; however, their existence and activity in our environment is a 100-percent fact, from my direct observations.  This reality should help support those claims by other witnesses of fantastic and bizarre UFO occupant activity, as being a very real physical possibility. All of the testimony given here is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. ((NUFORC Note:  This is one of two high-quality reports which have been submitted by the same witness.  The other sighting occurred in Dallas on December 11, 2013, at 20:00 hrs..  PD))',\n",
       "       \"Multiple sightings of an egg-shaped craft. ((NUFORC Note:  We will invite the source of the report to submit separate reports, so that they sort by the date of occurrence.  PD)) Hi!  My name is ((name deleted)).  I Prefer people know my first name.  My UFO encounter consists not of one but 5 different encounters which I believe to be of the same or similar type craft.  I would like to share my story if I would be allowed. My first encounter was when I was 4 years old in Lake Stevens, Washington, in the year 1993. I do not remember the encounter but my mom does.  She, myself, my brother and grandma all witnessed a UFO that night around 10:00 pm at our house.  I was in the living room.  My mom said she looked out of the kitchen window because she noticed a bright light and she said it looked like two car headlights coming towards her, except in the sky above the treeline.  All of a sudden the house filled with blinding white light which lasted for a few seconds.  The power to the house flickered just before the light came.  She stepped onto the porch and she said she saw 1 bright ball of light roughly 200-250 feet in the air above our house.  According to her the size of the craft was at least 3 times the size of our house. It hovered motionless for about 10 seconds before taking off in the blink of an eye in a zigzag pattern.  North to south over the treeline.  It took but a second before it was gone.  The UFO did not make a sound at all. I feel I must add that I had nightmares of 4-5 foot grey beings with big almond shaped eyes when I was around 3 or 4 years old doing things to me like operating or performing surgery on me. Long before I even knew what aliens were or what they looked like. My second encounter that I had I was living in the same house and I was 6 years old. Around the same time as last time if my memory is correct, the house again filled with a brilliant blinding light which lasted  about 5 seconds.  I remember the light did not hurt my eyes but made visibility very bad.  I could however see my window next to my front door just fine and I ran towards the window to see what was up there and I saw a bright white oval or egg shaped craft just above my house at again around 200 feet in the air.  I would say the craft was at least twice the size of our house.  I wouldn't say the UFO was massive but was quite large in size.  I stepped onto my porch only to see it take off in a zigzag pattern at thousands of miles an hour or so it seemed. It was gone in the blink of an eye. A small detail I can add to that is that it seemed like it disappeared and reappeared about a 100 feet away every time and stopped for just a moment before taking off again. The event! occurred over the span of roughly 35-40 seconds.  Again, the event was soon followed by strange dreams of grey beings however being so young I didn't understand that they were not normal dreams. Still to this day I can remember every dream I had of those beings like it was yesterday.  They may be just dreams.  That's all I can say about them but strange quin-cadences nonetheless. My third encounter I will briefly explain because it is almost exactly the same as the previous two. I was living in the same house.  I was 7 years old in 1996. my house filled with light which lasted a few moments.  I stepped onto the porch immediately already knowing what it was.  I however did notice that the craft wasn't as bright as before and I noticed it was made out of a shiny, reflective metal.  It took off in a zigzag again and it was gone.  The power also flickered again just before the light struck like the previous two times and the UFO did not make a peep.  Me, my mom and grandma all saw it. The fourth encounter was again in lake Stevens. I was 11 or 12. I can't remember however It was not at my house.  I was in the back seat of my moms Volvo. We were traveling on a trestle going from the city of Everett to Lake Stevens, Washington.  It's basically a long free way bridge.  We were near the end of the trestle coming to a large hill going into lake Stevens.  I Noticed to our left a large glowing ball of light traveling slowly towards us.  When I noticed it it was about 500 feet or more out and about 300-400 feet off the ground or more. All of a sudden it was upon us. Just a 100 feet or less above our car. It was matching our speed which was 50 miles an hour. It followed us for only a few seconds before it hit our car with a bright beam of light which filled our car with light but did not blind my mom who was driving. It did not hit any other cars near us with this light. At least not that I can remember.  My mom said WOW!, LOOK AT THAT DREW!. She actually pulled over. S! he asked me to grab the camera out of the back seat of the car but I struggled to get the case open for just a few moments before the craft which was still hovering over us distracted my attention and gave up and gave her the case. She never got the case open in time.  The craft actually started descending on us slowly as we were parked.  The craft hovered over our car for about 10 seconds before taking off to the right of us in a mind-boggling speed in a zig-zag pattern.  It traveled in that direction for about 2 seconds and got almost a mile away from us before shooting straight up into space.  It again didn't make a sound.  People had also parked on the side of the trestle next to us.  I didn't notice if anyone was  videotaping it but I remember my mom said for a moment she thought the craft was gonna land on us it got so close and one of the other onlookers had mentioned the same thing. The craft was egg-shaped except was a little more elongated than an egg. It was clearly ma! de out of a very reflective metal and when the craft was hover! ing abov e us the light seemed to dim but I could tell that the light was emanating from inside the craft. We could have probably fit 10  Volvo's in the craft and still had room to spare. I did not have any strange dreams before or after that event. My 5th encounter is the most profound thing that has ever happened to me, even still to this day. I was living in Oregon at the time. I was 15 years of age. I was living with my mom, brother and sister and my moms boyfriend at the time. The house resided on a large steep hill about 15 minutes out of town. The driveway up the hill took about 3 minutes to drive up. The house was primarily surrounded by thick forest. It was around 2:00 A.M. I was sitting on my couch in my living room playing halo 2 on my x box 360 alone. My mom was in her room on her PC and her boyfriend was up late working downstairs in the basement. All of a sudden my x box and TV shut off. The power remained going to the rest of my house. It was just my x box and TV that shut off. For a moment I was confused and angry but for just a moment because immediately after that I noticed a bright light through my window to my left just above my couch. I then peeled the curtain back and saw a bright ball of light just outside my window. It didn't immediately click in my head what it was but just a moment after I peeled the curtain back the house filled with a brilliant white light. The light this time was so bright that I could not see my hands when I held them in front of my face. The light lasted for about 15 seconds. As soon as I saw the craft I screamed out”MOM THE UFO IS BACK” and started running to her room and then the light hit the house. I froze. I could not see anything but light. I yelled out”MOM,The house is filled with light! “Can u see” I asked and she said no. I then realized that the windows were still visible! . Everything in the house was white except my windows. So I walked towards the window and as soon as I got to the window and peeked through it the light stopped, so I stepped out onto my back patio. What I then saw after that I will never forget. What I saw was a glowing metal craft. It was again the same shape as before. Light was strobing through the craft in all colors of the spectrum. Like what oil would look like with sunlight reflecting off of it. It appeared almost as if the light was some sort of force-field around it. The craft remained metal in appearance however the light pulsing through it was also notable. The craft was easily 3 times the size of our house or at least it appeared to be fairly large.  About half the length of a football field or so. It just hovered there above our back patio for about 20 or so seconds. My moms boyfriend had stepped out onto the patio with us for a moment before he ran back inside to get the camera. My mom had turned her head for just a moment to yell out” hurry up or your going to miss out”. During that time I my eyes remained fixed on the object. As the craft hovered there, I witnessed a window open up. A part of the craft had become completely transparent. The “window” quickly moved from the right side of the craft to the left before the window went away and the craft became solid again. What I saw during that short period of time, or what I thought I saw were a dozen or more white or grey skinned beings with arms all held out like they were holding hands and were all looking right at us. The craft then flew up 50 or so feet slowly and then took off at light speed and I'll explain why I use the term “light speed”. The craft traveled in a zig zag pattern like before. Except this time when it moved, it left images of itself behind following all the way back to its original position. I'll try my best to explain this. The craft would disappear and then immediately reappear a few hundred or so feet away leaving behind hundreds of translucent mirror images of itself. and when it reappeared the craft would then catch up with itself. Like the main bad guy from the movie,chronicles of riddick. How the guy could seemingly jump out of his body,travel a little ways and then his body would then catch up with his ...soul or whatever. My apologies for the bad analogy but I find it very hard to describe what I saw. I've never seen anything like it in my life nor have I heard of anything like that before.  What I saw that craft do didn't just defy physics, it defied reality.! The craft seemed to move almost as if the light couldn't keep up with it. In my opinion anyways. My moms boyfriend made it out with the camera but by time he got the camera turned on the craft was already gone. The light the UFO emitted into the house filled every room in our 3 story house. The door to my moms room was closed and her window drapes were down and yet her room became filled with the light too. My moms boyfriend that was working in the basement at the time had no possible means of light to get in there. Basement stairs were shut, there were no windows and the only light that should have been in the basement should have been from his lamp however the basement too became filled with this bright light. Don't ask me how but that's what he said to me. Also another detail to add to this strange event is my x box. I was playing my game before this event took place and my TV and x box shut off on me. Well, when I got back into the living room I noticed my box and TV were on and not only that but my progress had remained in the game. I even died and re-spawned somehow during the x box being” turned off”. I find it funny though because in halo, you play as a space marine guy who kills aliens.  Maybe it wasn't a game they found amusing.  I don't know.   Before I end this story I must add that a few weeks after that event I had a very weird dream. Several actually but one  in particular  worth noting(in my opinion). In my dream I woke up and walked into my living room. My living room was pitch black however a bright light was shining through the windows behind me. And in the corner of my living room the light had shined on something. I stepped a little closer to see what it was and it moved slowly into the light. It was a 4 to ! 5 foot being with a elongated skull and big almond-shaped eyes. It was wearing a silver or metallic-looking suit that was skin tight. It had one blue stripe running down its right arm and a white line around its waist almost like a belt or a seal you would see on a spacesuit except thin like a string. It also had a blue patch on the middle of its chest with a weird symbol on it. I distinctly remember having an overwhelming feeling rush over me. The emotion was love. I felt like a heart-warming sensation come over me and I suddenly got the feeling like this being was very happy or it was very happy to see me. No fear came over me. Just an overwhelming feeling that I remember to this day. It also felt like this being was very fond of me. It just looked at me for a few moments and then I don't remember the rest of the dream and I woke up with my pants soaked. Not sure why. Maybe I sweat in my sleep. I don't know. I'm not claiming I was abducted by aliens. I'm just noting strange quin-cadences. I have researched UFO's and witness testimony's and anything UFO related honestly and I have yet to hear of any case quite like mine. I'm posting this to you all in hopes that someone else will read this and post they're story like mine. Perhaps I'm not the only one with these specific kinds of experiences. I know I'm supposed to only submit one UFO sighting at a time but I didn't have a sighting to report, I had a story to tell. my apologies for the lack of visual evidence. I carry my camera on me at all times at the ready now, just in case.\",\n",
       "       \"Flying Spacecraft's invasion ,abducting airplane,hiding out in my attic of my home and a prisoner. My home is one block East from Henry Hudson Pk. Way, and I was looking out from my mother's window looking up in the sky to notice this big bright light of a space craft rotating itself to a different shape.  Then it went in the area of Henry Hudson Pk. Way.  I notice an air plane was passing by this unusual spacecraft that's when the space craft was shooting some kind of light at it that the air plane was struggling in flying a head and it was a stand still in the air as if this object was trying to duck the airplane to get into this object.  Then when another airplane flew near the both of them that's when that airplane was about to disappeared was lucky to break through this force.  I thanked God that the airplane was freed from this unknown object in the air.  I wish for someone to come to where I am and you will get to see what goes on here.  I am not joking and this is not a hoax neither.  I am more convinced that the little air crafts that are shape like Diamonds have landed on my roof.  I heard all kinds of weird sounds as if someone is using an electric saw or something to slice meat.   At 23:00 I notice the many little Diamond shape crafts that surround my home as if I was their prisoner . I hear all kinds of sounds in the Attic.  I hear  singing of some dong as if they were going to Kill someone.  I believe its called a say sons. When I lay down on my bed I feel a burnt pain  on my foot and to notice i see a beam of yellow light hitting my feet. I yelled out loud to stop it that they are hurting me.  Then i dont hear any sounds and dont see any beam of light flashing down on my feet.  About five mins. later they do it again with them using their beam of light on me.  I dont know what they are going to do with me either kill me or have me converted to be like them. I know what I am writing to you may sound that its off the wall but its the Gods Truth.  I have filled out more than one of these forms and no one has made the effort to come out to where I am to investigate this.  Oh, another thing that they control your use of the internet, laptop and phone use that you have to get ou! t from your home to go dome where else to call,text or what ever you may need to use your cellphone. I urge for someone to come here and its a must!\",\n",
       "       'Alien-shaped head peaking over my backyard fence. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the source of the report, and he sounded to us to be serious-minded.  However, we are unable to certify that the report is a sincere portrayal of what was experienced.  PD)) Hi here! I\\'m new to South Phoenix, Arizona. I recently moved from a small town Indiana about a month ago. I moved in with my boyfriend in a gated community in Scottsdale. I fell in love with Arizona, I\\'ve never seen anything like it, honestly. Unfortunately, my boyfriend & I are no longer together so I moved in with a friend in South Phoenix. I can honestly say I\\'m enjoying myself here a lot more than I was with my ex, ha ha. My beliefs aren\\'t related to the famous biblical forum, but more of believing in the universe. I believe that whatever we think & feel on the inside, is what we attract to us on the outside, known as \\'the law of attraction\\'.  If my religion were to be labeled, it\\'d be closest to Buddhism. I\\'ve seen a few indescribable lights in the sky while driving, or star gazing, etc. I\\'ve always believed in extraterrestrials, never doubted.  My parents, and a few of my friends think I\\'m a little nuts for having an open mind , but I am…why not?  It\\'s currently March 2nd, 2015 -- 11:18pm here in South Phoenix, Arizona.  A few days ago, I had just laid down & was searching for something to watch on Netflix.  I felt like I needed to take a break from family guy, & watch something a little more, well, WAY more different. I came across the movie called \"Dark Skies\", I remembered wanting to see it in theater a few years ago. Anyways, it turns out it was about alien abductions that this family was experiencing. It was a great movie.  Was very believable that something like that could really happen. Remember -- I\\'m open-minded.  Earlier tonight, I was relaxing on the couch trying to find something to catch my eye on Netflix once again.  I came across an Alien Abduction documentary.  I watched it half way through, and then just lost interest, so I ended up turning it off.  After I turned the tv off, I decided walk to the kitchen to get a nice cold cola from the fridge.  As I walked passed my double door entrance to my backyard, for some odd reason I decided to take a peak out.  Well I did just that, & I saw something for the first time that at first, I didn\\'t even realize that what I was looking at, was for real.  There is a brick fence about 5 1/2 in tall that divides the backyards of our neighborhood.  The street light was stinging onto the back to the neighbors house, & I suddenly noticed a figure, it was a little bigger than the size of a basketball.  But unlike a basketball, the back of the figure went into a cone shape.  It was so still, that I just said to myself \"Oh, well look at that! That thing on the fence looks just like an alien head, ha ha.  \"Well, I end to walking away after about 7-8 seconds, I get my coke, then on my way back to my living room, I decided to peak once again, again, for some odd reason.  Turns out the alien head shaped figure I was looking at, had disappeared.  I\\'m not asking anyone to believe me, but I know what I saw, & I know for a fact that my roommate was upstairs, sound asleep.  I\\'m not really frightened by it.  To be honest with you, I think it\\'s kind of cool.  -- New kid from Indiana.',\n",
       "       \"Three short entities surrounding my bed, possible abduction This event occured on the night of February 15th at approximately 2h30 in the morning.  Roughly one week later this incident, I've decided to openly talk about it, even if I don't feel really comfortable talking about it. I am a 47 year old guy, living by myself.  My house is located in the northern area of Sainte-Brigitte de Laval, a small and calm town located at about 40 kilometers from Quebec City. This is a really calm area without any neighbors.  It's basically a dead end.  The house is surrounded by forest, mainly pines and regular trees.  This is not a suburb.  This is the woods.  The house cannot be seen from the street and there is no street lamps nearby.  To reach my house, I need to take my private access road (less than 100m).  At night, the whole property is pitch black as I hate leaving the exterior security lights on all night long.  Since I had bear issues in the past, I installed four motion detection halogen flood lamps that are pointing at each corner.  I live there alone. My typical weekend night is to watch movies on my laptop computer in my bed.  I also drink a few beers, maybe half a six pack.  I normally start watching the first one at 9 PM. When I feel like watching a second one, I start it right away.  If I don't fall asleep and I feel like it, I'll watch a third one.  But sometimes I'm too tired and fall asleep during a movie. That's what happened the night of the incident. I started the first movie at 10:30.  Nothing unusual.  Did not feel sleepy at all. The movie ended at 12:30. Perfect for a second movie.  I started it right away.  It was a long movie and if I closed my eyes, I would fall asleep almost instantly.  The movie was so boring...  Eventually, I felt asleep for good and woke up during the ending credits.  I tried to rewind the movie back to the moment when I fell asleep.  But I kept falling asleep and waking up. Then I woke up and my laptop has died (forgot to plug it to its power supply).  There was no lights on inside or outside the house so I tried to grab my phone and use it as a flashlight:  couldn't find it. Then I saw what I can describe as a flash of bright yellow and white light outside the window.  My heart started racing because I've never seen lights other than my motion dection lights over there.  Since my bedroom window is looking at my backyard, this could be a city truck or any truck with rotating yellow strobes.  Plus I did not hear any sound.   I approached the window and looked closer.  For a split second, the flash or light came back and all 4 motion detection lights powered up at the same time.  I rapidly checked out every window of every corner of the house but couldn't see anything that was moving.   Needless to say, my heart was beating hard and fast.  I went to check out if all the exterior doors were locked when the motion detection lights turned off.  Checked out the time on the microwave oven, it was 2:30.  I could regain my bed and put my laptop aside. Trying to figure out what could have caused this, I fell asleep again. I was too tired.  Then, it happened. I could describe it exactly like when you stare at the sun or a bright light with your eyes closed.  You can see a reddish-orange glow even when your eyelids are closed. I was awoken by the bright light that was covering my entire home.  My eyes seemed sealed shut but I could see a powerful red-orange glow through the eyelids.   At first, I though that I was dreaming so I did not bother opening my eyes.  Rapidly after, when I began to see dark figures blocking the light for a second or two, I woke up and realized that I was not dreaming and that my entire house was indeed lit by an unknown light source.  I could hear what I can describe as a humming noise that I could not hear with my ears, much like a vibration my head was picking up.  I then opened my eyes and was shocked to realize that there was three short humanoid beings, about 4 foot tall, with big heads, big slanted black eyes, a slit for a mouth and a really thin neck, all surrounding my bed and staring at me.  Their arms, hands and fingers were long and slim.   I was terribly scared, and felt like every hair of my body had risen. I tried not to look at them because their head traumatized me.  I couldn't stop looking at them in fear.  The last thing I remember is hearing a high pitched noise inside my head and then, nothing, gone, it's the morning already.  Looked outside and noticed that snow in my backyard is now lower (at least 1 feet).  My experience induced me great fear but now I know what many people have been through.  I am currently not okay with what happened, so for now I stay in a motel room until I am ready to go back.\",\n",
       "       '\"There it was\"  The time was in August and the year was 1970.  I remember it well.  One of those silent peaceful nights’s when everything is still.  You can hear the engines running out in the channel from the shrimp boats and the people talking along the shore who are getting ready to go flounder gigging.    I rocked on the front porch of my grandmother\\'s house, looking across the road at my home.  I could hear the clear call of the whippoorwill, in the woods behind my home.  A sound that is rare to hear.  “O” how so lonesome that sound makes you.  A sound that stir the soul of a man. There had been sightings of strange lights in the sky over the outer banks by the local people of Carteret County, NC.  People had gather at Radio Island and were on top of the sand dome with their cameras and binocular.  Seen mostly by the night fishermen. People would say some things about it at the local grocery store, but just laugh it off.  They knew down deep it was best to be silence. One night, I and another guy were taking a ride over in Gloucester, NC, on the Straits Road. Yes!  There is was over the road a bright white light with a round shape at the fork of the road.   The passenger began losing the radio signal and was adjusting the radio station before he had looked up.  He began complaining about the radio signal.  I said with a loud voice, “radio” Look!  Then the auto wanted to cut off and I was doing all I could frantically trying to keep it running by pumping the excellator.  She is going to cut–off.   The engine in auto had cut off, we where rolling toward it.  It was very bright white light round shape about 38 to 40 feet diameter and above the ground about 30 feet.  Yes!  Time had lapsed.  It was there in the sky and went up some.  Then I could hear the loud sound of jets engines getting closer as they approach.  The UFO took off, fast away.  I then saw the after burners kick in and the loud sound from the jet engines as they took off after it.  They were just above the tree tops, they were so low.  I started the car and though to myself.  I had to put the car in park to start it.  No conversation were said, to one another until the passenger said put me out at home. So I did. I also went home.  My mother said where have you been.  I just had a phone call from the USAF who wanted to talk to you.  For you to call them.  I said, I’m not, because I haven’t done anything wrong.   I left and went back and stop to a little service station called Fake’s Store.  I went in and asked Fake if he heard anything.  He said, know. I said, you didn’t hear the jets.  He said was that what that was.  I thought they were going to take the roof off the building but that was about 2 hour ago.  I said, no, it was about 15 minutes ago.  Well, he said, I’m getting ready to close.  You are closing early.  He said, there nothing wrong with my clock.  I step outside and looked at my watch and it was 2 hour behind.  I then began to get worried.  Could I have been abducted and have lost 2 hours of time.   I then went home again. My mother said the USAF called again and I told them what you said.  They told me to tell you that you better keep your mouth shut if you knew what was good for you. Yes!  I had to go back to the area of the sighting, me and the passenger.  We saw a farmer feeding his cows at a Troff.  We slow down and asked him if he saw anything.  He said I have seen you boys riding by here a lot.  Did you see anyone messing with my cows.  We said no.  The farmer said it was the most ungodly thing done to them cows.  Well, they paid me for them and I’m not supposed to talk about it.  As he was looking around to see if anyone was looking. At that farmer\\'s yield he moved his cows out and let the growth of woods grow up around it.  There is now a tower at the corner of the field and the government moved all the, cows, and animals off the outer banks. A few days later the passenger said.  You know if we talk about this, people will mark us and it might make it hard for us down the road.  I think it would be best just to be silent.',\n",
       "       \"4 Orange Orbs Over Sanford, Florida, near airport. I live in Sanford, FL, just around the corner of the Sanford airport.  Last night, I saw 4 orange/red glowing orbs above my house starting around 10:00pm.  The first one I saw while I was driving home.  It was hovering over a commercial building.   As soon as I stopped my car to see it better, it started moving north.  I got back in my car and drove home (about 4 blocks away).  I was watching it the whole time.  It eventually just vanished in an area that it didn't make sense for it to vanish.   As soon as I got home, I had to change the windshield wipers on my car.  I was telling my husband about what I just saw because it reminded me of a story our neighbor told us when we lived in Casselberry, FL, last year.  She had seen 3 orange lights flying above our house.  I had also seen similar lights when I lived in Pompano Beach, FL, about 2 years ago. As soon as I was done telling him what I’d just seen, another orange light came from over the horizon.  It flew in the same flight path as the first one I saw.  We sat there and watched it the whole time (roughly 5-7 minutes).  It flew right over our heads and did not make a sound. It seemed to be the size of a small car about 1,000 feet off the ground.  It disappeared right as we heard a jet from the airport taking off.   About 20 minutes later, as we were finishing replacing my windshield wipers, another orange light appeared, again in the same flight path as the other 2.  We watched that one appear over the horizon, and when it was about halfway through the path the other 2 had taken, yet another one appeared and flew the same path.  Right around the same place that the other 2 disappeared, so did these two.  It almost seems like they were going into an invisible mothership or something.  Because they weren't high enough to be hidden by clouds, and they weren't far enough to fall out of our range of sight. They were a dull orange (similar to metal halide street lights) around the front and sides.  The rear had red lights and some type of glowing red “antenna” could be visible form the back.  When they were directly above us, you could see a very faint white light alternating flashes from the front and back.  A couple hours later, helicopters flew nearby, you could hear them and see their flashing lights distinctly. Whatever the orange/red lights are, they are definitely not planes or helicopters. I've checked the box at the bottom about being contacted by an investigator.  These lights seem to be coming up near us for the last 3 years.  Coincidentally, that's how long I've known my husband.   Last year, after the neighbor told us she saw lights over our street, my husband told me about how he feels like he's been abducted when he was a kid.  He showed me a place on his foot that appeared after his apparent abduction (I think he said it was about 20 years ago).  Anyway, this spot on his foot looks like a drill hole and has not healed since he got it.   I'm wondering if there may be some correlation between his alleged abduction and the fact that it seems like I'm seeing UFOs all the time now. Please contact me by email.  Thanks!\",\n",
       "       'Red Sphere in Night Sky, Flashes Consecutive Red/Green Lights at Witness The following is what happened to me on 4/23/14 at 9:16 pm in front of my home on the island of Oahu-Honolulu, Hawaii:  On my way home alone from a nearby store, as I walked through my parking, I looked up in the night sky spotting a completley red sphere moving silently towards the northwest, at a fast rate of speed (its movement reminded me of a high traveling satellite). As soon as I noticed the red orb (bigger than a helicopter, equivalent size to a small turbo-prop plane), I immediately realized it wasn’t a satellite, aircraft, or helicopter (it made no sound).  This orb seemed to notice me back (this was my initial gut-feeling), stopping dead in the sky at that moment.  Then it started quickly flashing a green light, then a red light, and then a green light at me, consecutively, around 6-8 times and then stopped, while remaining stationary in the sky above.  The colors reminded me of that popular electronic game in the 70’s, called Simon (best example of what the red/green lights looked like) with musical tones corresponding to it’s 4 large colored buttons when pushed; or the red and green colors of a traffic light.  However, there was absolutely no sound related to my sighting of this hovering red orb, it was completely silent. It felt as if a message was being communicated to me directly, although I didn’t understand it. I mentally thought back to the object, “I don’t understand the message, what does it mean?”  As the orb still remained motionless in the sky above me, nothing more flashed towards me, nor did I get any other communication (gut-feelings/thoughts) from this object.  Next, I told the object mentally, “I believe you’re friendly, at least I think you are, but I’m not sure what it is you want.  I will tell you anything you want to know, you can ask me, but I don’t want to be abducted & examined,” (laughing to myself now, knowing this sounds absurd as I stood in the dark staring at this sphere for around 5 minutes), although I was serious at the time this happened, and this was the dialogue running through my mind. Shortly thereafter my neighbor came down the path, I instinctively knew I wasn’t going to share this with him (I don’t think he would’ve believed me anyhow), so I mentally said goodbye to the red orb, still remaining stationary in the sky above me at that time. Before I walked up my stairs, I greeted my neighbor who was unaware of the object.  As I walked up the stairs, I wondered if the red orb was still there. I called a close friend as soon as I walked in my place.  This friend said she believed my story, however I’ll never know for sure.  About a half hour later I did go back outside to see if the red orb was still there…it wasn’t.  I regretted leaving the encounter so soon.',\n",
       "       'Two-hour UFO event in Franklin County, Vermont, multiple witnesses. Hello Peter. First, let me tell you that I am a big fan of yours and have been following your reports on Coast to Coast for the last several years.  I have always considered you to be an authentic, credible UFO investigator.  In addition to the cases presented in your reports, I have studied several hundred similar cases and I am, therefore, more than a little familiar with the UFO phenomenon.  However, only beginning this week can I say that I know with 100% certainty that highly advanced beings, piloting incredible and terrifying UFOs, are conducting some kind of research in Vermont.  Based on everything I have learned from you, I am also convinced that these beings number in the thousands or tens of thousands globally and that their research is being conducted all over the world on a massive scale. Now about myself.  I am in my mid-thirties and live with my wife in Franklin County, Vermont, on a hill overlooking a small valley of trees and cow pastures, which rests between the towns of Milton, Saint Albans, and Cambridge.  I am a well educated, rational ((deleted--scientific)) laboratory technician.  My mother, who lives in a neighboring county, is a PhD research scientist, whom I would consider to be extremely rational and never prone to hysteria or exaggeration.  My wife is also well educated, and very practical - even stubbornly skeptical - about strange phenomenon and other events which have no bearing on her life. Two years ago, my mother was walking with a friend, who is a radar operator for the Air National Guard.  The path they were walking is very near the downtown area in our largest city, about 25 miles south from my house.  She tells me the sky that evening was dark, except for the many stars which were at that moment unobscured by clouds.  She felt something odd and was compelled to look directly overhead.  She and her friend then saw a very large, black, triangular craft with faint orangish lights, one at each corner of the craft.  She said that the craft was so dark and so quiet as to seem as if it was absorbing light and sound.  They watched as the craft moved slowly from north to south and finally disappeared from view after a few minutes.  Apparently, my mother\\'s friend was at least somewhat familiar with similar objects, but provided no information.  My mother told me about this experience immediately after it happened because our close relationship and mutual respect permit this. This week, I had my own amazing experience, and my wife shared it with me.  On the evening December 4th, 2014, at approximately 9 p.m., I was exercising in our basement and noticed a very bright light which I could see through our basement window.  I ran up our first flight of stairs, opened the front door and stood on the porch.  Before noticing any detail I felt an intense sense of dread.  I looked up toward the sky at a 45 degree angle, directly away from our house, toward Vermont\\'s highest mountain peak.  In the near distance, perhaps a half mile from where I was standing, I saw an extremely bright object, pulsating red and blue lights, bouncing around slightly.  I stood for perhaps 30 seconds or a minute watching this object, feeling transfixed but also very fearful.  I recalled in that moment some of the stories of abductees who were paralyzed prior to their close encounters, and screamed at myself mentally to turn around and go back inside.  I walked quickly inside, locked the door, and ran up the next flight of stairs to our living room, where my wife was sitting and watching television.  I turned off all the lights and then the TV and told her, \"you need to see this.\"  I brought her to our picture window, oriented precisely eastward in the direction of the object, and asked, \"WHAT IS THAT?\"  She leaned toward the window, squinted her eyes and her mouth dropped open.  At the same moment I noticed another similar bright object to the north, but this object became a secondary consideration to us because it was partially obscured by tree branches near our window and appeared to be farther away and at a higher altitude.  I asked her to stand there and continue to watch the object for unusual flight patterns if it began to change position.  As she did this, I ran to my office to retrieve my Celestron Model #21035 travel telescope. When I returned, I noticed a light on the ground directly below the UFO, in a location that I know to be a patch of cow pasture void of any structures.  I quickly found the UFO in my telescope lens.  What I saw shocked me down to my core.  The object was disc-shaped, bright, colorful, pulsating and bouncing.  The pulsating red and blue lights appeared to come from within the craft, passing out through its walls.  I then found the light on the ground below the craft and saw that it was cylindrical, orangish-yellow and was illuminating a white angular object which sat closer to my house on the grass.  After two or three minutes, I decided that I would not see enough detail in the light and turned the telescope back toward the UFO. When my wife again examined the craft, she asked, \"What is that other thing...in the air, closer to us, in the bottom right corner of the view?\"  I looked and saw the corner of another, mostly black and camouflaged object, perhaps two or three hundred yards closer to us.  I watched this object for ten minutes or longer and noticed that it was slowly rocking around and up and down.  On several occasions, I could clearly see that the bright, pulsating disc was casting enough light on the angular craft to illuminate two corners of what appeared to be a triangular black craft. My wife paced around the house, communicating irritation with me for looking at these objects with such interest at first, but eventually, after at least a full hour, parked herself on a chair near me saying, \"I feel weird...I\\'m scared...I don\\'t like this.\"  At some point, I noticed that the light on the ground had vanished.  Then, I noticed that the pulsating disc was calmer - more stationary and less bright.  The red light, especially, was mostly or entirely gone and the craft appeared to settle into a lower-energy state.  The triangular craft remained in the same position for another thirty minutes.  Immediately prior to going to bed, I saw that the disc and triangle had both changed positions.  The disc was now higher, perhaps directly above the triangle, which was now oriented with a single corner pointing downward.  Suddenly, I saw the full form of the triangle, which was hovering with its underside pointing directly at my window.  I saw one faint, circular orange light at each of three corners. The next day, I bumped into a resident who lives on the road directly opposite my house from the previous evening\\'s activity.  This individual informed me that she had seen an object that matched my description of the bright object at 9 p.m. on December 3rd and 4th.  I knew this meant that the object might return soon, and watched from my window throughout the night of December 5th.  Two bright, pulsating objects appeared shortly before midnight, at least one half mile farther from my house than they had been the previous night.  I watched for over an hour as they appeared to follow a grid pattern slightly above the tree tops near a river. A quick scan of the internet reveals that Vermont is currently a hotspot for these phenomena.  Many people have reported similar objects in my area; MANY more have likely seen them and remained silent. I have attached a sketch of the two objects from the night of December 4th.  I would be willing to speak with you by phone, but I must be careful not to allow my name to be associated with my report as it is presented to the public. Thank you for all of your amazing work Peter!',\n",
       "       'I have had contact with an unknown party that can move matter around like star trek.  I was possibly abducted. Firstly I did not see a UFO I contacted one.  I was lying in bed thinking about the transporter system on the fictional starship Enterprise and after comparing it to other technology  I thought that perhaps they can do it and if they can they must have starships.  It was at this point that I spoke out loud and said, captain kirk, if your really up there,and you can really move matter around, can I at least have my front tooth back. I went to sleep and when I went into the bathroom in the morning.  I looked in the mirror and seen that my front tooth was restored and I remembered what I had asked the night before and to this day I still feel overwhelmed by what happened. I have given the incident much thought over the last 2-3 years and I think that it is a possibility that they heard me  because I was on a harbour at the time and said (captain), and the place where I was staying was an old hotel called ( the Anchor) and the organization running the old hotel as a hostel was the salvation army and among their ranks they have  a (captain). So what I am saying is that there must be some kind of surveillance systems that links up information that has similar content and passes that information on to related people. And yes after this happened to me I believe that captain kirk is a real person, and perhaps he always was and the secret about him and the starship got out and the powers that be made up star trek to cover the truth.  What I now know for sure is that  all sound  especially words are being monitored by persons unknown and they definitely have the power to move matter around. When I asked out loud for captain kirks help someone answered and gave me back my front tooth.  But the question now is do you believe me and what do you think.

       "       'So I will tell you the rest of the story in this one report. About 10 years ago, I\\'m staying at my fathers house...laying in bed...about 9:30pm...lights are on...I\\'m just laying there.  All of a sudden the ceiling opens up....almost like if you took a hammer and demolished the celling...a whole about 2 feet in diameter, jagged.  I could see the rafters, the flex conduit, everything looks brand new.  A glowing orb descends from the hole....hovers maybe 1 foot below the ceiling, orange in color about the size of a basketball. It just sits there and rotates for about 20 seconds.  Of course Im thinking \\'what the hell is this\\'?  After about 20 seconds the orb ascends back through the hole in the ceiling, the ceiling closes up and its gone. About 2 years later I get a call from my father...he says he has a story to tell me. What he tells me is that he\\'s laying in bed...middle of the night, wakes up to a sound approaching in the distance.  He tells me it fly\\'s right overhead.  Sounds like two large pieces of rock scraping against one another but somehow electrified and very loud...as loud as a guitar amplifier cranked all the way up on the roof.  The sound passes overhead and off in to the distance.  As it exits, he tells me that he could hear dogs barking off in the distance. About 4 years later, I\\'m laying in bed in Oakland, CA, and wake up and hear a strange sound. As I lay there and listen, it approaches and passes right overhead.  It\\'s exactly the same sound as my father told me about. Like 2 large pieces of rock scraping against each other but electrified somehow.  As this passes overhead I see what looks like flame coming in through the blinds on the window.  I thought maybe the transformer on the pole outside blew up.  As the object left I can hear dogs barking off in the distance.  Same thing as my dad said. The next morning I went outside to see if there was a transformer that blew...there\\'s not even a pole there...never was.  (In retrospect I question what that light was)...I don\\'t think it was flame at all. About 2 years ago I was driving with a  girlfriend to go get a bottle of wine. Safeway was about 1 mile away and I\\'ve driven the route 1,000 times.  As we are driving back home make the familiar right turn off of the main street, and a few seconds later I notice that I\\'m lost.  I have no idea where I\\'m at.  I pass a school, some apartment buildings and a few small businesses.  I ask my girlfriend if she recognized any of this and she said no.  I see a stoplight up ahead so instead of turning around I decide to just drive up to the intersection to see where I\\'m at.  As I approach the intersection I realize that I am on the opposite side of the street where I should have been but headed in the correct direction.  All I have to do is drive through the intersection, going straight through and I\\'m right where I want to be.  Even taking a left turn wouldn\\'t have put me in that orientation.  Taking a left would have put me on the wrong side of the street but not heading in that direction.  I would have been headed in the opposite direction. When I got back home I asked my buddy how long we were gone. he said about an hour.  It\\'s a one mile trip!  To me that was about 15 minutes. The reason I\\'m telling you all this is because I was telling a friend about this the other day and he was saying \"there\\'s a good chance you\\'ve been abducted.\" I have no memory of ever having been abducted but I don\\'t think that means a whole lot. I\\'m curious what you guys think about this and I\\'m doing my best to describe it....not easy with words. Please advise… ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))',\n",

I was trying to scream or even just move, but I couldn't.  I just remember him telling me that everything was going to be fine, they're not going to hurt me.   I asked them what they wanted. They said they just had to run a few tests and in the blink of an eye the other two beings were on both sides of me the two of them put there two fingers underneath my lower back and my shoulder and I lifted out of the bed as if weightless then they floated me towards the slidin! g door and the flash of blue light took me out after that all I remember was a cold table and feeling very uncomfortable and then I was back in my bed sitting up and it was 430 in the morning.

       "       'UFO sighting and possible abduction with time loss and distance teleportation. At 7:21pm I was departing out of the Brotherhood Lounge in Olympia after a few drinks to catch the last bus to Aberdeen/Hoquiam which left at 7:20pm.   As I ran out the door of the bar I turned the WIFI off on my phone and bolted across the street.  I don\\'t recall any traffic coming towards me or around me as everything appeared silent, so began to cut across the parking lot near where the bus departed, as I was near the middle of the parking lot this bright light appeared above me.  Knowing that is was not the moon as that was visible in the sky this orbital light was practically a spotlight illuminating a circle on the ground around me.   Phone still in hand I pointed upwards to it and held the photo button down snapping these 4 HD shots before my phone went black and rebooted itself immediately with the Apple icon.  I laughed because of how the damn thing decided to reset itself and with the quickness.  Next thing I know time warped, it slowed dramatically as alm! ost like moving through Jello.  I recall being angry that I was force-ably being slowed as I needed to catch that bus as it\\'s the LAST bus to the area I was going to.  Struggling through the atmospheric pressure I saw the light around me became a yellowish/orange hue.....now I\\'ve seen something like this before many years ago but was startled at this moment. I recall the light above me feeling like some sort of stealth silent helicopter as waves went through my body like being in a MRI/CATSCAN and then everything went bright white and POW!  Next thing I know I\\'m standing in thick fog bank of the side of the road feeling a bit bewildered of my surroundings but yet calmly okay.   Nervous, I light a cigarette and immediately my body rejects it causing me to vomit, I take a second drag and it happens again.  Music begins playing through my headphones I\\'m wearing which were previously in my backpack as I cut across the parking lot.  The music is the Gorillaz song 99-2000, I look to my left and her comes the bus through the fog. I pitch the smoke and wave the bus down, it stops....door opens and the gal driver says, \"I almost missed you there as it\\'s not a normal bus stop.\"  I thank her stopping and go to place what typically costs me $3 into the drop box and she say\\'s it\\'s only $1 which I kinda shrug off as the money dropped and figured I just payed it forward on some deal they have going on.  She asks me if I am okay, I say yes and get on the bus....as I look down at the people on the bus they all had this \"odd\" smile on their faces and a orange glow or aura about them.  I sit down and end up messing with this guys backpack reorganizing his stuff in it without him noticing.  I comment to the bus driver how she\\'s doing a fine job cutting through this fog and the guy who\\'s backpack I\\'m messing with, without looking at me says we are dealing with \"Flice\" which is supposed to be fog ice....like I was supposed to know exactly what that meant.   I zip his pack up without anyone else noticing and listen to the song playing through my headphones and then realize as we pull out of the fog bank a ways, we are actually about 20 minutes to Aberdeen, WA. I know now that I \"reappeared\" in Montesanno about 40 miles from Olympia and I somehow beat the bus which takes about an hour to get to where it picked me up. WTF!??!?!??!?  I road the bus in to town and got off the bus doing a quick magic effect with my hat and a tangerine which I gave to the driver when she acted surprised and thanked her for the night. Once off the bus, I light another cigarette, and immediately rejected it, vomiting again and walked to a local bar called the Ace of Clubs. I forcefully choked down the smoke between gags and then went inside. I turned my WIFI back on and light flickered as I walked in. I didn\\'t make eye contact and asked the female bartender for a PBR....and began uploading the photos I took to a group on Facebook that I\\'m a member of and start typing out what happened via my phone.  I began to tremble a bit and the photos give me a problem with not uploading in sequence and I\\'m pissed at my phone as I continue to type and that bartender asks me if I am okay?  I look up at hear and say, \"No...yes...well no...I\\'m not sure....something just happened to me that I cannot explain.  Will you please look at me and tell me if I appear intoxicated or under the influence of drugs or something?\"  She tell me I look perfectly sober and I began to tell her what happened showing her the images.  She listens, I cry.  She walks away and walks back I tell her some more and then her husband comes over eye looking all blurry but with a grin on his face as he begins rubbing my back.  He was a large man with very warm hands and asks me if I am okay?  I tell him the same thing I originally said to her and begin to describe the light I saw and he walks away shaking someone else\\'s hand and I grab my phone, jacket and bag and split trying to video chat my buddy via my phone and having total glitch errors with it all.  I walk across the street and check my bank balance and light another cigarette to no problem as I walked off towards my mother\\'s house.

I then had a white tool put onto my hand, and when it was taken away a minute later, there was a cut.  I can feel the chip, it is not scar tissue, as there is no scar.

       "       'Missing time and possible abduction while camping in Daniel Boone National Forest My fiance and myself were camping in a remote locale in the Daniel Boone National Forest.  We had followed an old logging trail with multiple switch backs to an elevation that was probably 400 feet above the valley floor.  We were camping alongside a cliff in my 1970 VW Type III wagon. We had grilled dinner on a hibachi and sat by a small camp fire until approximately 23:00 hrs.  We then turned in for the night inside the wagon with the hatch door up and side windows open as it was fairly warm that night. At approximately 02:30 hours on the next morning, I woke up and noticed bright white flashing lights that were coming from the direction of the valley below as the light was illuminating the headliner of the car.  There was sufficient light to see the (still working) VDO clock on the dash to verify the time. I thought, \\'This is odd that lightning is coming from the valley below\\' and \"I can\\'t move\\'. Then at a later time that I cannot determine, I woke up and heard a faint buzzing noise, complete pitch black darkness, the sense that someone or something was at the rear of the car, I was in a perilous situation, I was moving slowly out of the back of the car (I remember a momentary glimpse of the car headliner and hatch door hinges which should have been located near my feet), and the feeling that I was being rotated facedown as I was moving feet first out of the rear of the car.

We were both very hungry and felt like we hadn\\'t eaten in a long time so we took off for town to find a restaurant.  When we went into the restaurant I headed for the restroom to throw cold water in my face and wash up.  Then I noticed that my beard looked like it was 2-3 days old and I had shaved the morning before. We bought a newspaper before eating and noticed that it was dated two days after we had camped in the forest. We didn\\'t talk much about it for several days as we were in a kind of daze.... About ten years later while reading a Bud Hopkins book I realized that I might have an explanation for the deep, circular scoop marks on my left shin that showed up after the trip to Kentucky that I tended to ignore for years.',\n",
       "       'Bright discshaped glowing noiseless object making u turn and disappering slowly upwards leaving smoke or fog under it. We were crayfishing at night at our country house in Dalarna, ME, and my brother and 2 friends.  I was sitting in the front of the row boat, my borother was rowing and the 2 friends was sitting in the back of the boat.  I was gazing at the beautiful stars, no clouds at all and the full moon was on the left side over the treeline.   Suddenly, I noticed a glowing ellipse-shaped object in the sky on my right.  It moved slowly from right to left.  And I said \"whats that?\" to the others pointing at the object in the sky.  After I said that and I saw them look up at it, everything got kind of strange,  It felt like I popped in dreamlike state, however I kept watching it and I estimate it was 300 meters above the water, it made a u turn towards us but stayed in front of us.  It stoped moving and started to go upwards, very slowly and as it did some kind of fog or smoke appeared under it, making it cone of light, like from a flashlight in smoke.  It kept rising up until the contours got fuzzy behind the smoke and finally disappered completely.   The strange thing about this mind blowing event is that I could not talk about it with my bro and friends the day after, simply thinking of what I had seen made me feel sick, but somehow I felt I needed to try write it down, however I couldnt, the only thing I could make with the pen was an oval elips on the paper.  I couldnt talk about it with the others until maybe 10 years later, but when I did they didn´t remember, only one of the friends said, \"Yes, there was something strange in the sky that night\".  I put a lid on the memory for 15 years or so then suddenly I became super interested in the UFO phenomena, watched and listed to countless material on internet, and I submited a report to the swedish UFO aktuellt (Claes Svahn).  I cannot rule out that an abduction might have occurred as well, but I have not tryed to investigate that with an regression hypnotist, maybe I should?  The object was about the size of the moon, but much brighter and made no sound at all.  The location is not close any airport and no military bases either.  The lake is named Vällan, about 3 kilometrs from the city Falun.  I\\'m sorry for misspellings but Swedish is my natvie language.   Keep up the good work!  Much appreciated.',\n",

I was out looking for Bigfoot, in the hills around St Paul, Minnesota, over the weekend, after enjoying a nice meal at McDonald's.  I was separated from my group of expeditionists, and I saw a bright light that seemed to move in a zig-zag pattern.  I was confused at first, but thought nothing of it, until it seemed to get larger, and closer.  I realized it was actually a metal craft that was shaped like the a chevron, kind of like what you see on a gas station sign for a chevron location.   I felt frozen in place as the bright lights got closer to me, and I couldn't move.  I felt a strange warmth engulf me, and then I was in a strange place, it metal.  I wasn't alone, I couldn't make them out, there was a strange haze in the air, and a buzzing in my ears.

       "       'A large slow-moving triangular object passed over the highway in silence while we watched in awe. In the winter of 1990, I was driving my girlfriend back to Winthrop College in Rock Hill, SC, from Columbia, SC, where I lived.  We would often take back roads, rather than I-77, to break the monotony, since we made this hour long drive twice on most weekends.  I think we were on Hwy. 200, or some other curvy secondary highway near lake Wateree, north of Fairfield County, when we saw the object on this otherwise abandoned and empty road.  It was a cold night with a cloudless sky. My first thought was that we were witnessing the undercarriage of a large blimp because the object seemed to be moving slowly and silently at about the pace of a light breeze.  I soon realized that it was far to big to be the undercarriage of a blimp, and I could see stars above it.   I stopped the car and got out to watch it.  I did not know what I was looking at so I crouched down behind the open door of my VW Golf to watch, and started shaking.  It was cold, but I was also scared and excited.   What we saw was a triangular object which seemed to be at least a couple of hundred feet long, but possibly much larger.  It also appeared to be made from beams and cross members because I remember seeing stars in the sky through it.  It also had lights on the corners which reminded me of the can lights you see in theaters (the ones which you use different color films over to light a stage).  The color of the lights were a dull greyish blue-green.   The object was not very high over the pine trees as it passed and If I had to guess I would say it was no more than 200 feet off the ground and possibly only 100 feet high.  The object was almost silent, but I remember hearing a low rumble which increased and decreased in tempo so that it sounded like I was hearing a diesel train engine a mile away loading cars.  I have often asked myself if I was hearing a train in the distance or if the low rumble came from the object.....I am unsure. After we watched it pass we stood in shock, speechless.  We got back in the car and talked about how we would need to contact the authorities or the news paper to see if anyone else had seen this huge object, but it seemed to completely and strangely slip our minds that we had witnessed this.  It was not until about a year later when a friend and I were making fun of someone on TV who claimed to have been abducted by aliens, that it all came back to me in a rush.  My friend was incredulous and did not believe me so I asked him to call my girlfriend which he did.  She told him exactly what I told you but was also surprised that it had completely slipped her mind from that night until a year later. About 15 years ago, I wrote down the details as best as I can remember them and drew a sketch of the object.  It was not until about 10 years ago, while I was telling my father and his wife about the event that I was introduced to the idea that others have seen triangular object too.

       "       'Possible abduction I have sat on this for close 35 years, due to the fact that I find it highly disturbing.  But I feel the need to put it out there. Either late July or early August 1980 just outside of Nevada City, California.  I’m 15 years old and at summer camp.  I’ve recently been sick and due to this fact I’m stuck at the camp with the other campers who were sick as the rest of the camp heads out for overnight horseback riding, water skiing and other activities. So there are 6 or 7 people there.  I don’t remember the exact number, due to time and a real desire to forget that night completely.  Snow Mountain Camp is a rich kid camp in the Sierra foothills just northwest of Nevada City.  The camp itself is well spread out with 6 cabins a pool two arenas for horseback riding a barn and dining hall and two houses 1 that the counselors use when on break and the other that the camp owners live in. I was occupying one of the lower cabins that was situated in a gully on the other side of a hill from the house were the counselors were.  I was the oldest boy in the cabin and we were doing typical camp stuff, ghost stories from a Steven King collection.  Lights out was at either 10:30 or 11:00 and we continued reading for another 30 minutes or so with flashlight after lights out. It was soon after we stopped reading that the event happen.  I call it an event because I can’t think of any other way to describe it.  I had put my flashlight up because I was ready to sleep, when the cabin was enveloped with what I later described as white noise.  It was debilitating and we were all screaming at the top of our lungs.  I remember visions of mathematical equations and that another of the boys said he saw musical notes and that another said he saw something resembling hieroglyphs.  This went on for around 30 seconds then silence and the cabin was filled with the most vile smell I’ve ever smelled.  We stood there for a moment or two when one of the other boys pointed at my flashlight which I had placed in the center of the room out with the beam facing up and it was on. At this point we all freak and run up the gully down the hill to the house where the counselors were.  We tell them our story and one starts to ignore us when the other takes my pulse.  Now we’ve been with them for a good ten minutes and my heart is still racing.  After checking a couple more they decide to come back and investigate. We get back to the cabin and there is a faint trace of the smell and my flashlight is still there still on almost dead now but still on.  We tell them that there is no way we are staying in that cabin and ask to move up to the cabin by where the 3 girls who were still there were.  We were likely safety in numbers. They let us and I don’t think we slept at all that night. But it was morning at the dining hall that things got weird.  1 of the girls who was up the hill from our cabin asked us if we saw it.  And we were like saw what?  And she described an object that resembled an old bowler hat that hovered over the area of our cabin for close to 30 minutes.  I almost vomited and the other boys turned ghost white and didn’t want to talk about it.  We begged her to tell us that it was a bad prank that the counselors had put her up to it, and she said she didn’t know what we were talking about. I am very aware of time because of that day.  What we experienced lasted maybe 30 seconds yet she said she saw it for close to 30 minutes. I know that something happened that day and I want to know if anyone else had had a similar experience and who do I talk to too get answers.  I feel like I learned something important that night, but a part of me is terrified to find out what. ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))',\n",
       "       \"First, some background information; I am a 42 year old kenyan, with only a high school education and currently a devout christian.  Etched in my mind for the past 30 years\\xa0is a dreamlike experience i went through when i was about 10 years old, which no one believed and which brought riddicule upon me from my brothers when i attemped to tell them the story.  I promptly shut up,and desperately struggled to push it off my mind for the next 35 years, when eventually i talked about it to a friend , whos complete trust i knew i had gained and thus had no fear of being riddiculed again. Still on background information, i have to state here that back in those days ,as a small boy in the small town of Nakuru, i definitely did not have any knowledge of these matters and only came to make sense of the experience in 2009, soon after my first exposure to the internet, where i inadvertently stumbled upon a story similar to mine.  I was stunned beyond words, and after a slow process of regaining my balance i shared with my trusted friend who had nothing more to say after asking a few questions which i duly answered. I remember two events which hitherto seemed unrelated until after i learned about abductions.  The first one ; I (aged about 10) am outside our home when for some reason i turn sideways only for my eyes to lock onto a landing craft some 50 meters away from where i was.  It was\\xa0 reddish in colour, somewhat spherical in shape but with edges like a diamond, with clearly visible landing gear below.  After it landed something happened that made me very scared and which i successfully pushed out of my mind over the years. With indescribable fear in me i turned and ran away towards where i knew my siblings were, (there are 6 of us ,i being the fourth child) where i had to go through a cornfield . I know i never got to where i was going and in all those years, even soon after the incident my memory used to register great confusion every time i tried to recollect what happened next. End of the first event.\\xa0 In the second event, which never seemed related to the one detailed above, i am wide awake in bed but completely covered with a blanket .  There is a ringing noise , a continous sharp sound seemingly coming from directly above me.  It goes on for what seemed like many minutes then stops, and suddenly something cold passes through my body at the chest  painlessly making me feel like i have been cut into two.  Then the bed flipped over taking me through a complete 360 degree turn, like what we used to call a 'back somersault'.  Then complete silence.\\xa0 In great fear i slowly moved my hand to the blankets edge, turned my head sideways towards it (i was sleeping on my back facing upwards) and lifted up the blanket\\xa0 for a peep outside. I remember what i saw vividly, and never was able to blot these images from my mind though i know i really tried. I saw non human creatures.\\xa0 Pale green/ grey colour. Small stature, like skinny boys.\\xa0 The room was circular and not lit brightly. One of the creatures really helped to etch the experience in my mind, such that i never could convince my young mind that i never saw it. It was the smallest of them all at about my size (remember i was about 10 years) . As i was fearfully looking at the scene it/he saw me peeping and came fast towards me which made me drop the blanket . Nothing happened and i lay there quiet for some time untill i mustured enough courage to peep again. He/ it came after me again and i covered myself up. this happened three times and eventually i stopped peeping and lay ! there terrified untill i fell asleep. End of recollection. Now , since then i have fought a long battle with these images, pushing them as far back into my mind as posible and trying to tell myself that, like my big brother told me in riddicule, it was a dream. I was never able to forget it.  Today , i am willing and ready to share my story with the world. I expect few people to believe me, some even to think that am looking for some monetary reward or fame, which is not really what motivates me to come out.  All i would like them to know is that there strange things going on in our planet, and humanity would do well by listenining objectively to what witnesses to these things are saying.  There is a sinister plot unfolding here, which all men should be wary of. ((NUFORC Note:  We attempted to correspond with the source of the report, but the e-address provided is defective.

       "       \"My brother and I were walking our two dogs around 9:00 or 9:30 at night.  We were almost home when we noticed two burnt orange, I want to say spheres, or orbs maybe?  I'm not quite sure, other than that they were lights.   My brother noticed them and thought it was a falling plane, but it was not moving, nor was there any sounds whatsoever.  It just kind of stood in the sky for a second before moving west.   My brother licked his finger and checked the wind, saying that there was a slight breeze going in the opposite direction.   I myself checked, and found the same thing.  It was slowly moving west when the third object, also a burnt orange appeared.  It made a triangle formation, but a very long triangle, before form a line.   The object in back started to slowly fade out over the course of maybe 10 to 15 seconds before disappearing.  Soon after, the object in front did the same thing, thus leaving only the one in the middle. after about a minute, it too did the same.   Myself and my brother quickly ran home and told our mother.  She thought it was a joke, but soon realized we were serious.  She was on the phone with my sister and my father.   I went back out onto the street and looked around, seeing the fourth object.  This was unlike the first three.  It was much larger, maybe even three times the size of the other three.  It was also a very pale blue and white hue, almost completely white.  It just sat in the sky, maybe about 1000 to 1500 feet up.   I ran inside and told my brother and mother, who each ran outside with me. It was gone. We looked for a while afterwords, but saw nothing.   About an hour and a half later, still very perplexed by the event, I took out one of my dogs to use the bathroom again.  I was just down the street when my dog, who doesn't ever make any mean gesture towards anything, started growling and barking at nothing.  I turned around to go home, as I was kind of, not scared, but not excited either.  I just wanted to be home.   When I got inside, my mom said I had been gone a while.  It had felt only five minutes had passed, but they said it was about 30 minutes.   Since then I've been having strange dreams, and dreams i can only barely remember.  I've also fallen ill in the past few days.  Without getting into details, it feels as though pure evil is exiting my bowels every two hours, as well as very painful gas in my gut.   Was i abducted?  This I cannot answer, for I cannot be certain.  I promise that all that i have told you all today is 100% true and honest.   Sadly, I have no video or photos of the event.  For this I damn myself for having left my phone inside. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, to ensure that the report was a serious-minded account of a real event.  The witness claimed that the report is accurate, and that he will attempt to have his brother submit a supplementary report.  We await the second report.  PD))\",\n",

Then i said look and both friends looked up.  The one of them said its another.  As we watched them, one stopped and another bypassed as if it thought the other one was a star. Then when the second ufo as ahead about 10 ft. away, the first ufo changed directions and went the opposite way of the second one.  Then they both disappeared. As we continued on i looked up in a different direction, I saw a huge grey triangle in the sky with a red light in the middle of the bottom and three blue lights on the tips.  It was moving across the sky quietly, then another appeared farther to the right.  It looked the same as the first triangle one, but instead of silence it as loud like a jet.  My two friends went inside, then both ufo hovered for about two minutes.  One disappeared, ! while the other hovered above me.  I then fell asleep.  Then my friends came back outside and said I was inactive (non responsive) for the first 30 seconds when they came back outside.  I dont remember being inactive but i remember going to sleep.

       "       \"Possible reptilian being sighting.   Greetings,   I am writing this statement on an incident that occurred on 10 Jul 2016, at approximately 6:00pm.  This is not a hoax, I am not looking for publicity or any such attention.  I am not sure is what I saw was a legitimate sighting and I am more looking more for answers to help me understand if what I saw was an actual alien being.   So, my friend, her son, and I drove from San Diego to San Francisco for leisure on Friday to Sunday.  On our way back, we were driving on the I-5 Fwy Southbound, towards San Diego.  We were approximately 10 mins south of Los Banos.  The scenery outside was barren, no buildings, structures  or people, just dry grassy hills and dirt roads on the sides of the freeway.   I was actually trying to get some rest when my friend the driver said, “What is that?” and pointed to the right side of the road.  I immediately looked over and saw a tall figure about 6 feet tall in a thick black monk/death looking robe with a big hood.  Now this was very unusual to me since it was about 90 degrees outside and in the middle of nowhere.  Why would somebody be walking around dressed in a thick black hooded robe in this heat.   So as we passed it, I had to get a good look at this person's face, so when I looked at it, it looked back at me.  And what I saw chilled me to the bone.  In this dark heavy hooded robe was a being that looked nothing human.  It had brownish green scales with a short snout and its eyes were large and blackish that glistened in the sun.  It was unmistakable even at about 100 feet away and it looked right at me with no expression.   It wasn’t carrying anything or had any equipment with it and it was walking slow and awkward as if it were looking for something.   I was scared to death, especially when it looked right at me, I thought maybe we should pull over and confront this thing, but honestly I was frozen and we kept driving.  I had asked my friend if she had seen what I had seen and her 12 year old son in the back of the car and they verified the same thing.  Again, I just am looking to see if what I saw could be a reptilian and if that is what other people report seeing.   I really wish I would have pulled over and went back to get some evidence or a picture, but after reading some articles on reptilians, I feel I made a wise choice.  I read that there may be entrances to their habitats in rural areas that may be unseen or hidden from humans.  That may indicate that there may be a entrance by Los Banos off the I-5 fwy going south.  I am not sure if other vehicles traveling down the road with us witnessed this sighting but it did happen and I am willing to swear an oath on it.   I also had unusual experiences that happened when I was a child that I believe was contact with Grey Aliens which is foggy, but I have some clear recollection and memories of some incidences where I may have been abducted and my mother can vouch for that and has some insight on that.  But that is another subject.  This is the first time I have seen a being like this.  Again, I am reporting this to hopefully gain some help to determine if what I saw yesterday could have been the real deal.  And I respectfully ask for discreetness in this matter.  Thank you for your time and I hope you can help me. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness on two occasions, and we were impressed by his eloquence and apparent sincerity.  We suspect that he is a very good witness, and highly reliable.  We have invited his friend and her son to submit additional reports, and we have invited the source of this report to submit an illustration of what the face looked like.  He reports that the creature had a prominent snout, like that of a dog, and that it had scales on its skin.   The witness states that he was formerly a member of the U. S. military.  PD))\",\n",

       "       'Cylinder over Columbia SC On Wednesday, September 30, 1992, at approximately 9:15 P.M.,  I observed a flying object I could not easily identify, and which has to date not been explained to my satisfaction.  I was driving northeast on SC 277 approaching the Fontaine Road overpass when my attention was distracted by a light overhead, shining through my open sunroof. My first impression was of a jet airliner in trouble; the object was far too low and moving too slowly, and was in an unusual location for a large plane.  I could see no navigation lights (i.e., no belly strobe, tail strobe, wing marker lights nor landing lights) and the tail area was lit by a fairly bright, large gaseous prominence, which I thought at the time was a tail engine on fire.  As I watched it, I continued driving, perhaps erratically, and tried to understand what I was watching. The more I studied it, the less it made sense.  Although my mind persistently tried to turn the object into an airplane, the actual appearance of the object defied explanation.  It was moving roughly northeast parallel to SC 277 in the same direction I was driving.  I estimated that it was at an altitude of approximately 5000 feet, judging from its size and the fact that it was passing through some stratus clouds.  It seemed to be traveling at about 200 mph, since it was leaving my car behind, and it appeared to be moving at about the same speed as a jet airliner approaching an airport runway. Clearly some kind of aircraft, the object was visible as a darker silhouette against the night sky, and the only visible lights were the tail prominence, like a jet fighter\\'s afterburner exhaust, but white, yellow, and orange instead of blue; or like a rocket\\'s exhaust, without the steam and smoke they produce; and a row of small, faint, white lights along the length of the aircraft.  These lights may have been windows lit from inside the aircraft.  The lights were faint as dim stars, and I had to look slightly away from them to see them clearly.  The aircraft appeared to be about the size of a jet airliner (if it was higher than my estimate, it was big), and seemed to cause a thin mist or fog to form around it, as if it were very cold.  It was shaped like an airplane\\'s fuselage, but in spite of my intense study, I could discern neither a tail stabilizer nor any wings.   I watched for the wings to eclipse stars passing behind it, but none did.  It also made no noticeable sou! nd above the sound of my car\\'s engine and the wind noise; an aircraft would have been audible at that altitude.  I watched this object for about two minutes and ultimately lost sight of it ahead of me.  The last view I saw was of a dull orange glowing dot above the northeast horizon.  While I was approaching the I-20 overpass and checking for merging traffic, I lost sight of the orange dot.  It was traveling in the approximate direction of Camden, where someone undoubtedly saw it.  I have read that the object was observed near Pontiac at approximately 9:17 P.M.. This object was sighted earlier in the evening near Aiken, then later by residents near Lake Murray, according to The State Newspaper.  Apparently it maintained its course for at least 80 miles, and I observed no change in its speed or direction.  I have included a map of its extrapolated course based on the known sightings.  I do not have the time of the earliest sighting near Augusta, so I cannot calculate its speed.  The aircraft was very elegant, moved gracefully as a dirigible, but much faster, and it left a vapor trail behind it.  The glowing tail prominence extended behind the craft for about one third of its length, where the light from the beam ended abruptly in a rounded point.  Its vapor trail was visible by reflected city light. In hindsight I wish I had pulled over to the side of the road and used my binoculars to get a more detailed observation.  At the time I thought I was watching an airliner going down, and I wanted to see where it crashed so that I could report its location precisely.  I would like to have had a video camera in the car, but I probably would have forgotten to use it for the same reason. When I arrived home, I wanted to call someone and report what I had seen, but I could not decide whom to call.  Which authorities are responsible for receiving \"UFO\" reports?  I did not have any proof, and the object had already left the area.  I decided that I would hear about it on the news the next day, and since there was nothing more I could do, I prepared for bed.  Too excited to sleep, I called my mother and said \"Mom, I just saw a \\'UFO\\',\" and laughed uncomfortably. The event was apparently traumatic for me, because when I awoke the next morning I had completely forgotten it.  I did not recall the event until four days later when my mother read to me over the phone an article in The State newspaper.  I had completely missed the many radio and television reports about the sightings. The descriptions given by witnesses to the event were obviously of the same object I had observed, but without any detail.  I am sure that dozens (hundreds?) of people must have seen the aircraft and I hoped I would hear more about it. I phoned The State newspaper and was told by an editor that they \"anticipated no further coverage until the next one.\"  The only \"authority\" consulted by the newspaper reporter was a USC graduate student at Melton Observatory (who had not seen anything) and he guessed that \"it was probably a meteor.\"  I have seen many meteors, but this object was not one of them. I spoke to a friend at the National Weather Service at the airport, and he said they received many calls during the event.  He checked with the control tower personnel and they reported nothing unusual.  I found it odd that when I contacted the airport\\'s public relations office I was told that I was \"the first person who had contacted them about it.\"  I have felt very uncomfortable when telling friends about my encounter, although I felt compelled to talk about it.  Most reacted with skepticism (as I would have), but they were patient and sympathetic.  Surprisingly, few have been curious enough to question me further, although this event was probably the most significant thing to occur in Columbia since the city surrendered to General Sherman.  I had always hoped that I would see a \"UFO\" someday, because I knew that I could dismiss it as an airplane, the planet Venus, or something ordinary.  I also thought that one had to be in some remote, unpopulated area, or at least be awake at some odd hour to see a \"UFO\", rather than in a major city at 9:15 in the evening! Some of my friends have tried to be helpful in explaining this event to me: my favorite theory is \"an experimental military aircraft,\" but who would fly an experimental aircraft over a densely populated city?  The F-15s and F-16s from area airbases seldom fly very close to Columbia, although one rarely crashes.  Why would an experimental (presumably secret) military aircraft be flown at twilight at an altitude and speed that would allow so many people to see, and possibly photograph it?  Why would anyone fly any aircraft without navigational lights or radar contact through the busy Charlotte to Columbia airline corridor?  I cannot help believing that the pilot of this aircraft must have known that her ship was being observed. I did not see any routine air traffic in the area during the event, and I do not know if this was an accident or by design.  I do know that the object was an aircraft of a type I have never seen or heard of before or since, except for two similar objects on video tape shown on television about two years after my sighting on one of the \"UFO\" programs: one was in daylight taped by a family preparing to depart on a vacation, the other was taped at night and only the familiar glowing, gaseous tail prominence appeared. At the time of my original writing of this record three weeks after the event, I had accepted that I will probably never know exactly how it flew,  the details of its structure, or who was flying it.  I still feel an indescribable joy and awe at having witnessed something so wonderful and significant.  I know that I shared this experience with many that night, and we all anonymously share a common experience that few can understand.  There is a lonely feeling even after years, which could be soothed only by discussing the incident with another witness.  I chatted by phone with another purported witness shortly after my article appeared in the Point, but he had not seen the same object that night, but a very different kind.  I received a call about a month later from a nice lady who had lost a half hour\\'s memory on a drive to Charleston with a friend several months before, and wanted me to tell her that she had been abducted by aliens.  I assured her that it was unlikely, and! that if she did not remember such an event even vaguely, it was far more likely attributable to her friend\\'s pleasant company than to alien interference.  However, I am no expert on these matters. I will not be terribly disappointed if this aircraft eventually turns out to be of contemporary terrestrial origin, but I really need to know the truth.  It is obvious that the device was created by an advanced technological society, most likely not our own.  It may be of extraterrestrial origin, or created by our terrestrial descendants, which would give me hope that we can survive these tempestuous times.  It may have been piloted by organic life forms or inorganic, artificial life forms.  It may have used an ionic engine to propel itself, or matter - antimatter annihilation and may have interfered directly with the earth\\'s gravitational field.  It apparently had stealth capabilities which rendered it invisible to radar, and possibly could also be visually invisible, but this function was disabled briefly by design or malfunction. It was very large and may have been more than one hundred meters in length.  It was very beautiful for a device.',\n",

Then I notice 3 lights in a triangular shape moving across the sky from North to South across the western horizon.  Then some lights would just go out, disappear and others would show up behind them and then do the same as they got to a certain point in the sky.  Then there was large flash again that light up the whole sky and my daughter got so freaked out, she was really upset, she thought aliens were going to abduct us.

April 16, 2016, between 5:45pm and 6:15 pm Vancouver, Canada, at the Queen Elizabeth Theater. I was sitting in front of the Queen Elizabeth Theater on Hamilton Street facing SW.  You can actually see the exact location I was sitting at and the building I'm going to reference by typing in the following url (google maps):  https://www.google.com/maps/@49.2802229,-123.1138337,3a,75y,134.77h,89.03t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1stq4hKv_aL179G_0htw5Qcg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656!6m1!1e1   This url will bring you to the exact location and you will be facing the same direction I was and seeing what I was seeing. I was sitting right there on the benches in front of the plaza and the building I'll be referencing is the tallest building on the left in the distance.  The large building on the left in front adjacent to the plaza is the Queen Elizabeth Theater. I had arrived early to an event and so I was just sitting there looking at the city when a man on the very top of the distant building on the left caught my eye.  He was wandering along the edge of the building looking over it.  I became very alarmed thinking that he was going to jump off the building.  I was very intent on watching him when way up high to the right (up from the flag poles) a dark disc or sphere shaped object caught my eye.  It just appeared beneath the clouds. It began moving toward the man on the roof, and as it approached him, I could tell that it was moving closer in our direction (later I determined it was heading NE).  It came over the top of the man and for a moment I thought I was going to witness an abduction, it just stopped and hung there, as though observing him. It was much higher than the man and he didn't seem to notice it as he was looking down over the edge.  Another man appeared and the two of the men began talking, as they turned to walk in the other direction, away from the edge, one of the men pointed to the sky, and both of them momentarily seemed to be looking at the same object I was.  They then proceeded to walk out of view (away from the edge) and the object then moved back in the same direction it had come from and disappeared into the clouds. It was very windy that evening, at least up high, as birds were taking advantage of the winds and sailing at high speeds across my view.  The disc shaped object made no sound, wasn't effected by the wind, it traveled in a general north easterly direction, came to a complete stop, waited about 60 seconds, and then traveled back the way it had come and disappeared into the clouds. Meanwhile, I had my cell phone and could have videoed the whole thing,  I even thought about videoing it but thought it was so far away it would be too hard to capture on a cell phone video. In hind sight, I could kick myself now, it would have probably been a very interesting video. The weather data for that day and time was:  Wind velocity:  9mph.  Wind direction:  from 280 degrees west to east.  Visibility:  20 miles.  Humidity:  82%,  Temp.:  54 °F.  Barometer:  30.31 Hg.

       "       \"White lights going around massive circular object It was the night of April 09, 2016 as I was riding my bike back home from getting something to eat in Redlands, CA.  For a while I enjoyed watching the sunsets, walking in the rain, and looking up at the stars, so as I was looking up at the night sky I noticed two lights crossing back and forth from each other. As I continued to ride home, I thought the lights were just a couple of helicopters.  5 min later I saw the lights again, but they seemed closer and I could see them more clearly.  The two lights were not any aircraft as they were moving too fast back and forth.  So I got my phone out to try to take a video but it was too dark but for some reason I could take clear pictures, so I spent and hour taking numerous pictures as the objects disappeared and reappeared every few seconds.  They were not red or blue but just a plain white colored light, so a good 30 min passed before I finally decided to go home. Once I got home, I've noticed a pattern of the lights, they were not two objects passing back and forth, but two lights going around this one circular object.  I saw this by the way the lights pointed as they disappeared and reappeared in this pattern behind the clouds in the sky.  I don't know if the object was the shape of a sphere, circle, oval, or cylinder as I only saw the lights going in a circular motion.  The best way to describe  what a saw was this circular object with two white lights on the object going around it.   Three hours later I decided to go outside to see if the lights were still there and they were.  My father, sister, and I saw these lights.  I would say the object was pretty massive, no where near the size of an airplane.  The way the lights were traveling around it I would approximate the size as the length of 10 planes or even bigger. I don't believe I was abducted as I kept track of time because I've heard stories before and I haven't had any physical harm.  I  hope someone else out there in Redlands or highland saw this object that I saw that night.\",\n",

       "       \"A possible ET abduction or experiment at bedroom during midnight hours It was the night of Friday, Sep 2, 2016.  After a long day of work, I retired to my bed and ready to sleep.  I also had a lunch meet-up appointment with my buddy on the next day so I went to bed by midnight, which was earlier than my usual Friday night sleep time. Perhaps sometime at 1 or 2 am, I was awake but still in my bed.  There was a bright white light emitting from my 4 o'clock (my head is at 12 o'clock position as a reference).  The light came from a white ball of light. It was so bright that my eyes were filled with tears and I had to turn my head slightly to the left to avoid it.  The light was so white and bright like it was coming from either a high power flood light or the sun.  It must be noted that although the washroom light was on during the night and it was in the vicinity of my bed, it was a energy saving light bulb and its colour was yellowish dim. I remember that right before I turned my head, there was a tingling sensation in my breathing tube traveling upward between my collar bone to my jaw.  It was itching and I remember that I brushed my neck with both hands downward. I don't remember seeing any entities or physical contacts during the entire event and I was laid down on my bed the entire time;  I also dont remember if my lower body was immobile. The next day, I got up with the sense of a bit restless but didnt give much thought. My friend later noticed that I was behaving a little bit agitated while I was looking for a parking spot at mall. It could be the result of the event or perhaps it was stress related. But our lunch was the last meat I have eaten for the past three months. Somehow that encounter changed my diet habit and I dont find red meat and chicken appetizing anymore.  My diet has become almost vegetarian.  I do eat fish and seafood from time to time, but I know I can also live without them.  My weight dropped and I felt more healthy and my brain more active for all these months. What really blew my mind was a physical evidence that I cannot simply treat this as a dream or human psychological response to stress.  This event had left a physical mark on my chest.  I found it very similar to the scoop mark left on some of the abductees' bodies.  It has been three months since the event and that mark still remains in its original shape and colour.  There is no other physical symptoms, pain or itching coming from it.  Of course, it wasnt there before and no scratch cannot heal in three months. I don't sense it was a malevolent encounter and I have not had another one since then, or at least any that I can remember.\",\n",

       "       'Large Black Object Moving Silently & Very Slowly UFO SIGHTING REPORT:  I have always been interested and drawn to, the idea of UFO’s and ‘visitors.’  However, I’ve never seen one or experienced an abduction, etc.  My husband ((named deleted)), had no interest at all in the subject, but would listen to my stories about UFO books I read or sightings others had experienced. My report date of this incident is an approximation, as I cannot recall it precisely.  I had to be away this particular week-end to attend an aunt’s funeral.  When my husband joined me the day of the funeral, he told me that he was in the upstairs bathroom of our little, country house, the night before, when something outside the window caught his eye.  I believe it was a warm month (summer?) but am not positive. We lived very close to a large, provincial park as well as an army base.  We often saw and heard large planes flying overhead, mostly during the day, but sometimes at night.  They were heavy and very loud.  I mention these things in case it is relevant to the sighting. Terry said that when he went to the bathroom window to see what had passed, he saw the back end of a large, black object, which I believe he said it was a triangular shape.  He said it was flying just above the tree line that surrounded our 1 acre property.  It moved slowly, steadily and very silently.  There were lights across the back of the object, that lit up sequentially (if memory serves).  We lived beside a field of hydro-power lines/towers and he immediately thought that it was flying so low that he was sure it would hit them, but it didn’t.  He continued to watch as it moved over the hydro lines towards the provincial park, and lost sight of it eventually.  He assumed it may have been headed to the army base. This is all the information I can recall.  If you need more detail please reply and my husband may be able to add a bit more detail. I could not believe that he was the one to witness this and during a time when I happened to be away.  Best, ((name deleted)) Ontario, Canada ((AMENDMENT FROM WITNESS)) Hi Peter, Here’s my husbands version of the UFO sighting.   *AMENDMENT TO ORIGINAL REPORT: UFO SIGHTING REPORT AMENDMENT: This is the recollection of the experiencer (husband) as he remembers it:  (Around Easter, 2001 probably the Tuesday after Easter Sunday) * I was standing in the upstairs bathroom one evening after dark. The window was partly open. For some reason, which I cannot recall, I looked out the window. There above me in the dark was a long horizontal array of circular lights like old headlights. The craft was not moving very fast and made no sound. It seemed to be very close to the roof of the house. Nearby in the direction it was flying was a row of fir trees about 60 feet high. I thought for sure that the craft would strike them and I waited. Nothing!. Then I thought that although it got by the trees somehow there are even taller hydro-electric towers in the direction of the flight path. Once again I waited for a crash but nothing. Then it was over. ((END ADDENDUM)) ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))',\n",
       "       \"Multiple Anomolies In An Ontario Town I was at a local park to do some wind sprints for fitness training.  I had arrived at the park around 20:00hrs and had just begun the workout, doing one sprint, and then while doing the recovery walk back to the starting point, I looked up into the night sky and saw a formation of three objects.  I was facing north, and the objects, numbering three, were flying low, in formation, going from west to east.  These objects were whitish, luminous, but not overly bright.  In fact, if I had not been looking up, it is possible that I may not have noticed them.  The objects were orbish in shape, luminous yet translucent, having a spectral aspect to them, and although the sighting was brief, it caused me to be very alarmed.  The lights did not resemble airplane lights, but had a spectral, unnatural appearance to them.   Alarmed, I walked quickly back to my vehicle and exited the park, as I felt threatened.  They were low and, having read accounts of abduction by ufos, I did no! t wish to be added to the list of abductees.  I was alone in the park, it was very dark, and I felt vulnerable upon seeing these objects.  Also, there was no sound emitted by the objects as they flew overhead.  This encounter left me shaken and anxious.  Early the following morning, before dawn, many dogs in the neighborhood were uncharacteristically barking together.  I was still jittery the following day, and had a very bad night's sleep after this encounter. Although I cannot recall the exact date or time, approximately two or three weeks earlier, my wife and I were returning from grocery shopping one evening, heading northbound on a street in Ingersoll, when we both noticed an unusual object in the night sky. It was approximately 22:00hrs.  The object was an orangish orb, and it was maintaining a steady position approximately 200 feet above a subdivision.  We observed it while driving closer to its position.  I said that we should go into the subdivision so as to get a better look, and when we went into the subdivision, it disappeared from view.  This earlier sighting was approximately one mile north of the second sighting, several weeks later. A few days before this sighting, my oldest son was having a cigarette on the patio before leaving for work in the morning.  It would have been approximately 05:00hrs. While having the smoke, he heard a humming noise in the air above him, although he was unable to see anything that may have been making the noise.  He went inside to tell my wife, but when they went outside together, the humming noise had stopped. As a background, I served four years as an auxiliary police officer and as a part-time jail guard.

Something made me check my phone immediately and it had read 7:00am.  I was then overwhelmed with an extremely uneasy feeling when I noticed my window was getting brighter and brighter up until the light had filled my entire room.  I was paralyzed with fear at that moment until I remembered hearing stories of people who claim to have been abducted describe how they were paralyzed also, so I said to myself, \"((deleted)).\" And bolted out of my room in which my cat and dog exited first with amazing speed.  I was too frightened to re-enter my room, so I stayed on the couch in the living room holding my dog who was shaking with his tail between his legs.  He would stare at the air as we listened to the unearthly and constant hovering sound and sometimes gliding sounds that seemed to come from all directions.  After about two hours whatever ! was making the gliding sounds stopped and all there was was the hovering sound.  The sounds grew faint and I had built up enough courage to try to go back to sleep.  When I got back into my bed I noticed a couple of voices that were coming from my ceiling and sounded like a bunch mumbling nonsense but from two men.  One sounding like my dad even though my mom and him claim to have been both asleep the whole time.

       "       'Aug. 15 12:00 noon spotted UFO over Mississauga Mr. Davenport was on Coast to Coast AM last night and prompted me to share an experience I had during the last two weeks of August 1957. I was a High School student at the time working for the summer in a lighting factory.  I made note of several odd sightings, but was not eager to report it to anyone. Because stories like this were likely to not have been believed. Last night George Noory interviewed Peter Davenport and the interview prompted me to report this. There were a series of events that I never connected until last night. About the 15th of August I was interested in observing the sky in the hopes of seeing the newly built CF105 AVRO Arrow that was being tested out of Malton Airport, Ontario.  It was about noon when I noticed a large reflective disk directly above me at about half a Km.  it was the same color as the blue sky with wisps of cloud exactly the same as the sky was 10 minutes previously.  I first thought it was a large weather balloon but it slowly disappeared as though it deflated or went straight up at great speed.  There was no sound.  In a few seconds it re-appeared as though it descended at great speed to where it was originally. the clouds rolled in and became invisible or camouflaged in wispy clouds. The following Wednesday evening I set out to drive from Toronto to Baltimore for a conference. I took a shortcut from Batavia NY on Hwy 14 through Pennsylvania. About 3am, I started seeing figures standing at the side of the road in the mist.I recognized them as greys later; when I heard someone describe a grey on a radio show. After the conference I headed north to Rochester with a couple of friends for company. I was driving on the New Jersey Turnpike about 2:30am and what seemed like a few seconds the sun was up and I was on a highway heading into Harrisburg. My friends were sound asleep. after a few miles and highway signs I was back on route to Rochester. It was very strange that I was not tired when we arrived in Rochester and spent ths rest of the day sight seeing then drove to Toronto. After a few hours sleep, I went to work at 7am still not tired.  it seemed to be i might have been abducted and losing hours of time.

It was soundless and chrome but I couldn't see a! ny doors or markings on it only the bottom.  All I remember was looking down after looking at it for about 2 to 3 mins but it seemed longer then back up and it was gone without a trace.

I saw a golden-brown star-like-figure over 200-300 feet (maybe 600) in front of me.  At first, it looked like this  ((link deleted)) It slowly moved west and now, I saw that it was a black object inside a golden-blackish sphere-shaped force field, the force field then slowly opened, and LO!  It was a tetrahedral (somewhat) polished black aircraft or UFO, its base was flat while it had a somewhat pyramidal body.  I had not seen such a thing in my entire life; nowhere!  Not in movies, TV, the internet or real life!  Obviously, I immediately ran to the other flat and called everyone, but, suddenly, my brother said (when he saw it) 'it is just an airplane, you are hallucinating', but my mother saw it too, somewhat...

       "       'I saw an orange orb Frozen in place in the sky, until some planes began to head towards it! Okay, so, I was in my room (which is located on the second floor of my house) watching a UFO documentary on YouTube via my PS4, when outside of my window I saw an orange orb just still, not moving.  I was watching a UFO documentary because, back in May, I had creepy dreams about being abducted by ufos and kept waking up to my window glowing Green light, and feeling a sense of sleep paralysis.  My window would also sometimes containing a bunch of computerized 0s and 1s, so I was doing my own version of \"research\" haha.   At first I  got nervous, and tried to use deduction to figure out whether it was simply a plane, a rocket, a weather balloon, or something unidentified, but then it began to act strange.  It stayed still for a good amount of minutes, which I couldn\\'t make sense of, but took the opportunity to take a picture anyways with my phone (my hands shook out of nervousness so it came out looking odd instead of orb shaped).   All of a sudden though I saw some blinking planes (I assume they were planes) heading towards it, about two of them at first, and the orange orb started moving DIRECTLY UPWARDS.  Not diagonal, just upwards, which made me think of a rocket for a second.  That\\'s when I took my phone again and started recording it, but my hands kept moving and I was breathing hard out of nervousness so that also came out bad.   Eventually it passed the planes, went over my house and when I stood outdoors, I noticed it no longer looked orange, but instead, was hard to see and blinking.  Then it went over the trees and vanished, followed by 4 planes.   Once it went over my house I took like 7-10 secs to get outside so it could\\'ve vanished then and afterwards what I saw blinking was one of the now 4 planes following the same direction, but I don\\'t know what to make of it.   The video I took had mysteriously ended up in my email trash bin, but maybe I hit something by accident and caused that bit.  I have further seen this orange orb 2 or 3 more times in July around the same general location each time, and someone else in my room witnessed the last time with me, but I haven\\'t bothered to try and get more pictures.  Also I am not saying this orb that keeps coming back is an alien, but it to me is unidentified.',\n",
       "       'FOLLOW - UP REPORT FROM REPORT IN 2017 **** I HAD TO SEND YOU THIS 2017 REPORT UPDATE **** :  I recently read a new report from 2017 in which the person reporting their incident heard a loud noise overhead of them, but they could see no object.  This is a follow-up report from a posting I made about my similar frightening encounter back in Kentucky in 1968.   This is somehow important, I truly believe!   I was around ten years old at the time.  My three first cousins and I were playing basketball in the street, at the front of our subdivision homes.  We were all bouncing the basketball around in a circle, when we heard a loud roaring/swishing noise coming toward us.   We immediately looked for the source of the loud sounds, and saw nothing.  We thought it was just and aircraft of some sort.   As we continued playing basketball, we all heard the roaring/swishing noises getting louder and louder approaching us.  Again, we all looked around, and again, we all saw nothing!  Not a single thing was seen anywhere in the clear blue sunny sky.   Then, in an instant, it all of a sudden was hovering directly over our heads, and the roaring - swishing sound was deafening!  The machine seemed to be large and massive, too.  Suddenly, a powerful massive yellow light shined down upon all of us while the roaring/swishing sound continued over our heads.  Everybody was blinded.   We yelled out for each other, but we were lost and separated.  We could hear each other\\'s loud screaming voices, but could not see each other at all.  The noise was amazing.  I even held my ears at times during this encounter, and each time I tried to look up at what was over our heads doing this to us, the bright yellow light was blinding - like looking up at the sun!  I could only see a few feet in front of me, and none of my cousins, either.   After what seemed like twenty minutes, the bright yellow light overhead suddenly just went off and the roaring/swishing object, whatever it was, flew away at a great speed.   We all just stood looking at each other with our mouths gaping wide open in terror and amazement.  \"What was that?\"  \"What happened?\" we were all repeatedly repeating?   After a couple of weeks or so after this incident, one strange day our entire elementary school classes was \"ORDERED\" up to the inside front hallway of our school to get a so - called  flu vaccine shot?  Our elementary school was located near where our UFO incident had occurred.  We got a shot alright!  I received a shot-mark, \"V\" Inverted Triangle, stamped on my forehead that day which is is still there and very visible today.   My girl first cousin got a \"O\" Circular Mark stamped on her forehead, still highly visible today too.  Later on, when I went home from school that day and my Dad saw the strange \"V\" mark indented in my forehead he got very angry, he stated that shots \"ARE NOT\" given in the forehead, and he called the elementary school to see why I was given a \"V\" Inverted Pyramid Mark on my forehead.   After a few minutes of yelling and arguing with them, he just suddenly put the telephone phone down and never mentioned the incident again.   \"What happened Daddy?\"  I asked him.  \"Just forget it,\" he said.  I knew that he had been threatened.  My Father was an Ex-U.S. Army Soldier and afraid of nothing, but this incident rattled him a lot.   I have never forgotten this amazing incident and we three surviving cousins talk about it still to this day.  I am telling you the honest truth as I well remember it.  This incident really did happen!   Me and my surviving two first cousins remember that bizarre day very well, to this day too!  Back when the incident happened, I didn\\'t even know what an \"V\" \"Inverted Pyramid\" was, but I found out a few years ago.  Today, after some investigating and research, I truly believe that all four of us cousins were \"abducted\" by that invisible UFO that day and we can\\' remember it.   For some strange reason I have seen several UFO\\'s in my lifetime, and had many other strange paranormal encounters too.  They continue to this day!  My girl first cousin has a paranormal life too!   Whoever sent you that short 2017 message, I just wanted to tell them that they are not alone - it happened to me/us as well.  These things are real!   I have now worked for the U.S. Government ((office deleted)) for many years, and \"WE ARE NOT ALONE!\"   Thank You,  ((initials deleted))',\n",
       "       'A short accounting of this even written for a memoirs class. UFO Sightings The sky was black—one of those moonless nights with crisp air and unending visibility.  If memory serves me it was early in the winter of 1974. I had just concluded a late-evening insurance appointment on Grantland Avenue west of highway 99 in Fresno, CA. Between 9:30 and 10:00 o’clock, I headed for my home in Rolling Hills on the Madera County side of the San Joaquin River.  The most direct route from Grantland Avenue was to take Herndon Avenue east to Blackstone and then north on Highway 41 to Avenue 10. A mile or so west of the Sierra Sky Park I noticed what looked like an airplane, roughly 500 feet above the ground preparing to land at the tiny airstrip.  Small planes landing here were not uncommon so I paid little attention to it.  But I did notice that its rate of descent was considerably slower than an airplane.  Maybe it’s traveling toward me, I reasoned.  The closer I got to the airport the more attention I paid to the object’s flight pattern. After seeing how slowly it was moving I ruled out the possibility of it being an airplane, and thought it was a glider.  The only other logical possibilities were a hot-air balloon or a helicopter. When I clearly saw its oblong shape I ruled out these possibilities too. Curious, I pulled off the road onto the soft shoulder, came to a stop, and turned my engine off. I got out of the car and listened carefully for any audible sound. Nothing. Not a whir, not a click, not a sound! The windowless gray object wasn’t hovering. Instead it slowly drifted in a northwesterly direction across Herndon Avenue toward the airstrip about a hundred feet above my head, still continuing its descent. I felt sure it would land but instead it drifted west and began following Herndon Avenue back toward highway 99. I got back in my car, turned around, and followed its white light. As I picked up speed it picked up speed. The faster I accelerated the faster it went. Then in the blink of an eye it pulled away from me, its intense white taillight receding into the black starry night. What was that? I thought. The traffic on Herndon that night was non-existent. In 1974, Herndon Avenue was little more than a two-lane country road. I’m calling the airport when I get home. Maybe they’ll have some information. Someone surely saw that. Once home I called the Fresno Air Terminal control tower directly, which you could do in the early 70s. “Has anything odd shown up on your radar screen the past thirty minutes?” I asked. “No sir,” the air traffic controller answered. “Why, what’s up?” “How could you have missed it?” “Missed what?” After explaining my encounter he said, “Well, for one thing it would depend on its altitude and location relative to our radar equipment,” and then continued with some additional mumbo-jumbo about how radar works. As I slowly calmed down from my excitement I explained to him in detail what I had seen. “You know, that’s really odd. Someone else called me from near the Sanger River bottom earlier tonight relating almost exactly what you’ve described.” And the following week I was northbound on highway 41 south of the San Joaquin River Bridge, when I noticed a bright-white light in the sky similar to the one I’d seen earlier. I felt sure it was an airplane and continued observing it as I crossed the bridge. As soon as the object reached Avenue 10 it took a laser-like ninety-degree turn to the left and accelerated out of sight at an unbelievable speed. Many people have experienced sightings of UFOs. Many scientists and the military downplay their existence because nine out of ten sightings can be explained by other phenomena. Some people claim they were abducted, with a small percentage of these asserting that medical experiments and who knows what else were performed on them. Since that time I have listened to stories and accounts of UFOs with interest on one hand, and with reservation on the other. Most of these sightings involve objects shaped like discs or triangularpatterned groups of objects. Nearly all first-hand accounts have not described what I saw—an oblong-shaped craft. With the advent of the Internet I have revisited the subject hoping to find photos or stories that more closely mirrored my experiences. My search uncovered only one sighting that described something similar to what I saw. This incident happened near Mansfield, Ohio, on October 18, 1973, and was widely recognized as one of the most notable UFO sightings that year. I was amazed to find how many similarities my encounters shared with this documented UFO sighting. Here are a few samples: “Cigar-shaped metallic object with dome, body lights, light beam, apparent lifting force…” “hovering relationship” “The object appeared solid…red light at the nose, a white light at the tail…” “No turbulence was felt and…heard no sound…” “…the object accelerated and moved off to the west, showing only the white “tail” light as it receded, and made a distinct 45 degree course change to the right, heading toward Lake Erie.” “On the ground, the driver and passengers of a car saw two lights, one red and one green… At first they thought it was a small plane flying low…heard no sound…its unusual qualities caused the driver to pull over and stop.” There is no doubt that what I saw was real. It was just out of my realm of understanding. I haven’t witnessed another sighting since, but will continue to search the skies for unusual events ((NUFORC Note:  Witness indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.  PD))',\n",
       "       \"place in early 1977 at the Georgia Academy for the Blind in Macon.  It was a residential school for the blind back then, and there were four students per room. On this particular day, I awoke sometime between five and six in the morning, and as was so often the case, I simply decided to lie there until it was time for our house parent to awaken us at 6:30.   All of a sudden I heard from across the room what I can only describe as a sort of trumpet fanfare.  It came from high on the wall.  I’m guessing there was only a second between the fanfare and the startling thing that happened next.  I heard my dear, sweet friend suddenly emerge from the exact place where the music came from.  It sounded to me as though he simply came through the wall, and he was sobbing as he was turned over in mid-air and then dropped on his bed.  He cried for a few more seconds before he went to sleep.   I can assure you I did not go back to sleep.  I can also say that the boy who slept in the bed next to mine had also been wide awake, and he heard the sound of a brass fanfare too.  I know he did, because I overheard him later that day humming under his breath the exact notes that had come from high on the wall.   I never did ask my dear, sweet friend what happened to him.  After all we were only seven years old at the time.   The following school year I heard that he had moved to another state, so I never got the chance to ask him about this terrifying experience.  Who in the world (or from another world) would have taken my friend out of his bed in the middle of the night, and where did they take him.  Whatever they did to him made him sob, and whoever brought him back just dropped him on his stomach on the bed.   I would gladly answer any further questions you might have about this most unsettling experience from early 1977. ((ADDENDUM #1 FROM WITNESS)) Thanks so much, Peter, for getting back in touch with me as quickly as you did.   I have been carrying around this story inside my head for forty years, all the while wondering who would believe such a thing.  The person who overheard the sound of the brass fanfare and who rehearsed it perfectly later that day is name ((name deleted)).  He presently lives in Atlanta.  In a phone conversation seven years ago, I asked him if he any recollection of the incident.  Alas, he had no memory of the experience.   The primary person in the story is named ((name #2 deleted)), and I wouldn't even begin to know how to contact him.  It seems as though his father was in one of the branches of the U.S. military, and was connected in some way to the State of Alaska.  I did not report the incident to anyone at the Academy For The Blind, and as far as I know, ((name #1 deleted)) didn't report it either.    In all your years of gathering and sorting through U.F.O. stories, have you ever heard anything like what happened to ((name #2 deleted)) in March of 1977?   Most curious of all in some respects was the brass fanfare ((name #1 deleted)) and I heard just before ((name #2 deleted)) materialized in mid-air.  What occurs to me now even as I type this is the possible link between ((name #2 deleted)) having been abducted, and his father's serving in the military.   Blessings to you, Rev. ((name deleted))  ((END ADDENDUM #1)) ((BEGIN ADDENDUM #2 FROM WITNESS)) Hey, Peter,   In whatever way my story might be helpful to the U.F.O. community, my heart would be gladdened by it.  Of course, let me know if there is anything else I might contribute to the burgeoning literature on abductions.   One question for you, (and it's probably one you get all the time), will I ever know what happened to ((name deleted--abductee)) that morning?  What was it I heard back in 1977?

       "       \"Texas incidents My boyfriend and I, were having a bonfire on my back yard on the side of the house.  We stayed outside all night, gazing at the stars and talkin about life.  I pointed at a star and told my boyfriend that it was a bright star.  As I pointed it out, it started zig zagging.  Then it stopped and just hovered over my neighbor's house.  That's when we knew it was a UFO.  It was about 300 ft in the sky, I felt like they were observing us.   Around 4:00am they left, I could see the direction of where the light was going to, until it disappeared.  That's was the first time that I have ever seen a UFO. After that incident, I started having nightmares.  Every time I would wake up in the middle of the night the time would be 3:48a.  When I woke up, I felt a presence in the room, but nobody was there.  I started looking online and doing some research.  I ran across a woman who had the same experence, except she remembers going into their ship. One day, I was walkimg, and I felt an object on my finger under the skin.  I'm very scared to let a doctor see it, because I don't even want to know what it is that's why I haven't.  That is my experience with the abduction.

       "       'Woke up inside of a tanning bed-like enclosement, appeared to be traveling with high turbulence, alien zapped me back unconscious Possible abduction?  Hard to say.. But here is an account of the incident.  I fell asleep on my couch in Columbus, OH at around 1:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on 7-8-17.  Then I woke up on my back, inside of what I equated to being an enclosed tanning bed-like apparatus.  It felt as if I was traveling at a high rate of speed and the ride was very turbulent.  I began to look around and one of the things I remember seeing is a worn down \"yellow labeling\" on the inside of whatever the hell I was enclosed in.  The next thing I know, at least my head was no longer enclosed as I saw an alien take an object and touched my forehead with it and I was \"out cold\".  I woke back up on couch in the exact same position I fell asleep on with my CPAP on just as it was prior to this \"possible abduction\".  I had no fear, not sure why..  In the ensuing minutes after waking up I tried to make sense of what had happened.  There was no missing time, I was back up within a half hour. Had a sick like feeling in my stomach, open waking up and its been on and off all day. Description of the alien I saw:  Structurally, it was similar to many of the common air craft aliens we see in our American pop culture documentaries (Short around 3 feet, thin body, big dark eyes, funny shaped head) accept this one had rather dark scaly skin, not true gray.  One the the things that stood out was the wide of its arm and forearm, it was the equivalent of a broomstick width the arm was the same width as the forearm.  I was unconscious seconds after he put the object between my eyebrows and forehead. Other information about me which you may or may not find relevant. Since the age of 8 years old I have been an experiencer of sleep paralysis -entity attacks, but even before this the paranormal world seemed to antagonize me at a really young age.  I can remember some things just before the age of two.  I\\'ve had thousands of negative nocturnal (non physical) attacks by paranormal entities, like smacking, prodding, choking and senses manipulation (I\\'ve also had a few positive ones like when I was tapped on the shoulder after falling asleep while feeding my infant son a bottle which caused the nipple to go adrift from his mouth.   Lately, I\\'d say within the last year, I\\'ve seen very bright lights in my dreams on more than one occasion.

       "       'I witnessed a total of 5 crafts interacting with each other (back & forth movement), one was extremely bright and moved slowly. Ask I was getting ready to go to bed, I was using the bathroom at around 11:15pm.  I noticed out of the corner of my eye a light which was not extremely bright, but just enough to catch my attention, so I studied this light for 15 minutes. I knew right off the bat it was not a helicopter because I saw multiple helicopters flying around periodically at much lower altitudes.  I also ruled helicopters/other human craft out because of the uncanny movement I observed.  The craft seemed like they were interacting with one another, slowly advancing, and then moving back to their former location. I went and got my brother so that he could witness the crafts as well.  He is a very smart individual and even he did not have an explanation for what he saw.  I then spotted a third craft a little west and directly straight up in the sky.  I went outside to get a better look.  I looked directly up in the sky and the craft slowly positioned itself directly above me.  I stood in awe.  I had a feeling I was about to get abducted, but nothing happened fortunately.  It soon dawned on me that there were at least two more UFOs west of the other three. One of the two western UFOs I saw was extremely bright so I recorded, and took the best evidence I could with my smartphone.  I am overwhelmed with confusion and I want to know more.  I personally think that there is a possibility that there is diversity among extra-terrestrials just like there are different species on Earth, and they might very well be at war.',\n",

There was no sound around all these crafts.  The crafts looked clear and transparent with a larger crafts guiding some of the smaller crafts that also formed a triangle shape following the rectangular ones.  There was no beings in the craft.

I was camped at a place called Lake Hamilton, alone.  I remember in the afternoon, standing at my campsite looking to the opposite end of the lake and observing a bright spherical light, low near the shore.  The next memory I have is of me sitting on a log in my campsite startled by a big buck deer jumping up right next to me.  I remember being amazed how close this deer was to me and not seeing it.  I remember being confused why the sun was setting and wondering where the time went.  Strangely, the following day a group Boy Scouts came hiked into camp.  One of the leaders was Bela Lugosi Jr. Later in my life, I would have other experiences which led me to understand that I was an abductee.  In the early 90's, I joined a support group and met others who shared equally strange, confusing experiences.  I appeared with Budd Hopkins in a Disney UFO Documentary.

They were changing formation and movement as no airplane can do.  When I ran to get binoculars, the friend that was with me, saw 3 of them.  Looking through the binoculars,  I could see they were continuing to change formation.  Before running to get a camera, the last I saw of the front one was that it took off in high gear at a very steep angle upward (nearly straight up).  By the time I came back with a camera, they were gone. What was REALLY eerie is that this exact date was the 42nd anniversary of Travis Walton being abducted by a UFO near Snowflake.

       "       'Silent Daytime Disc Disappears When Just Out Of Sight.  Prior to recalling abduction. ...I got out of work early and went the long way around when leaving mowhawk plastic.  I saw a disc floating as if it was pointing at me, at a parallel tilted angle.  I was taking off my jacket at the time while driving, so I kind of struggled for a second to get it off. I immediately starting bouncing my head up and down, just to see if i could throw it off, to assume it was some sort of \"controlled hallucination\" as Mr. Hilary Evans refers to it.  Only at the time, I had no idea of such notions, that this ufo could be a manifestation by the greys via implants... Anyway, I bounced my head up and down, thinking that maybe it was a projection on my window, I guess it seemed to real and since it was something no one ever sees \\'s, it was highly probable that I would question if it really existed.  Perhaps on a subconscious level, I could tell I was a pre-recorded overlaying image because the lighting didn\\'t mesh? idk. At any rate, I saw a ufo in Auburn, right next to A street.  I was stunned that no one else could have seen it yet I suppose it was back far enough, and low enough to where no one could have seen it. Looking at it now, I know that I was suppose to see such a craft considering what happend next. So I hit the gas as I went around the closed building at mow how plastic (building b I think). At the time their was a row of pine trees, with a fence on the other side.  Anyway, the silent daytime disc slowly floated across the sky from right to left, and I was aware that it was going to be out of my visual path soon. I hit the gas and was going about 35 or 40 i want to say, blindly while hoping that someone else didnt decided to leave work.  I suppose if I would have smashed up my car i would have blamed the ufo, considering i was being reckless just so I could keep my eyes on the object. It was black metal, i could see the welding marks, like extensions. It was a full out disc just as everyone has been explaining, and it was, in fact, the size of a football field, yet a perfect circle.  There were even windows deep into the center of the vehicle, as it did not spin.  It was silent as if it was not really there at all. Anyway, I was going very fast, while hunched forward and looking at this daytime disc.  I think some poppy song was on the radio, like poker face or something, I remember 1077 was on at least. Anyway it was just barely out of my reach visually, for about 2 or three seconds.  I had to slow down considering it was a right angle, though really I went as fast as i possibly could. It was odd, because this clearly was their goal, to appear in a place where i could not see them disappear. Anyway, I turned the corner and it was gone.  As if nothing was ever there in the first place. just as many other victims of the greys have claimed, the ufo seemed to disappear the second I rounded the corner.  It was so silent as if it was really some sort of implant manipulation.   What Dr Karla Turner calls \"illusionary tacts\".   What Mr Hilary evans calls \"controlled hallucinations\". When I first saw the disc i told no one.  I felt like perhaps it was the military playing tricks on me.  Then about 2 years later…  I recalled my seventeen-year-old abduction.  A bunch of snippets of blacked out moments, as the greys seemed to somehow have endorphin control. I kid you not, this must have been a warning since they knew I would recall?  Then again, perhaps it was just some other human uploading images via implants?  All I know is, I saw a ufo in October of 2005, and I didn\\'t quite think it was real.  I highly questioned it even though it didn\\'t really look like a 3d graphic, though nowadays it hard to tell. If you asked me, what do you think the purpose of abduction is? I would tell you, I think the \"alien\" greys take our out of body, I call it close encounters of the eighth kind, to have your out of body takin as you as awake, \"associated with having your soul sucked out from you\" - mandrake1975   Anyway, Please visit my abduction music at Pyridoxine Oxide  If you wish. Thanks for giving me a chance to explain.  I know I told mufon but they are kind of a joke, I looked and it seems you don\\'t even have my account.  Auburn 2005 Wa Black Metal Welded Disc, Disappeared conveniently as i rounded the corner, October 21st (I want to say it was the 21st) God bless, screw the greys. Thanks for giving me a chance to be heard, it really means a lot to me.  I hope you dont erase this post like the greys erased my memories involving the seventeen-year-old abduction.  GOD BLeSS!!',\n",
       "       'Green lites following man through canyon show up at destination, windows on photos. I was driving home from St. George, UT, to Enterprise, UT, heading NW on highway 18 at approximately 2:45 am.  At approximately mile marker 38 I saw two green lights to the SW of me, as I drove through the canyon the lights came closer towards me and was descending from the dark sky.  My initial thought was, “What a weird place to see a drone,” but as I thought through it I realized nobody would be flying a drone in this area at this time of morning.  Then as the lights got closer I realized this was a bigger object than I thought and it began hovering next to me as I drove.   I reached for my phone to take a picture and the object hovered above me then hovered just ahead of me hugged up to the mountainside, I wondered if it was going to land because it was so low then it hovered up and over the mountain, keeping close to the treetops and then out of sight in a northern direction.  As I came out of the canyon I scanned the dark sky looking for the green lights again but I didn’t see anything but stars.    As I continued driving home, I was questioning what I saw and my own sanity.  Then as I turned right down my street there were the two green lights again, about 150 yards in front of me and approximately 20 feet above the ground coming at me so I turned my lights off and grabbed my phone.  As I snapped two pictures the object just hovered in place for about 15 seconds, this is when i noticed the green lights spinning into and out of sight and the first time i saw an orangeish red light blinking below the green lights, then it floated away in a SW direction.  When I got home I could still see the green and red lights in the distance.  I was so creeped out and was afraid of abduction because of the object “following” and “watching” me that i sat in my car with the lights and engine off for 5 minutes before running into my house and locking all the doors, and shutting all the blinds.   I could not hear anything and I could not make out a formation w! ith my naked vision, but when I looked at the pictures I had taken I t hen saw the formation of the object, the windows in the object and some sort of blue glow at the top of the formation, none of those visible to the naked eye in the dark.  I continue to now hear a “hovering” sound over my house come and go as I type this, 4 times in the last hour but when I look outside there is nothing to be seen, then the sound just disappears, (I’m not 100% sure this is related, but we do not have known flying objects such as helicopters flying around Enterprise, and the sound is not that of an airplane).',\n",
       "       \"49  sec video taken of object seen over a long distance in travel, potential abduction, 20 min missing time.. Silver gray about 30 feet long with 5 panels and what appeared to be 4 windows.  The man was on his way home from work at Versailles, KY, at 2:54 AM.  Drove about 8 miles west on Highway US 60 West to get to Interstate 64 West, a quarter of a mile or so from the interstate,  He noticed something that looked like a low flying plane. He looked at the time on radio and it was 3:14 AM.  He has tinted windows on his car so he let his window down to get a better look at it.  At that time he was close to the stoplight for the left turn to get on the interstate.  The light turned red and he stopped.  He noticed the craft in the air stopped also.  It really got his attention then.  When the light turned green he proceeded left and drove up the ramp onto the interstate.  A tractor trailer passed and he got in behind it.  To his left on the other side of the interstate he noticed the craft, which was keeping up with his car.  The speed limit is 70 and the truck in front of him was d! oing about 60.  He decided not to pass and stay back and see what this thing was.  It went out of his view before he passed the Kentucky River bridge.  After the bridge there are rock walls on both sides going westbound.  After clearing them the craft appeared at about 10 o'clock to his left.  He let his window down to try and get a video of it, but couldn't get it. It was about a quarter of a mile from his exit home and it started to bear to the left.  He took the exit right and when he got to the end of the exit he stopped at the stop sign.  The craft made a right turn and stopped too.  He proceeded right in the left lane and the craft was on the other side of the road just above the utility poles.  He needed to go about 1/3 of a mile to make a left turn to get home.  It stayed with him.  When he slowed down to get in the left turning lane the craft turned left.   He made a quick turn right and raced up the street about a half mile maybe less to the Super America store.  He parked in f! ront and the craft went overhead and up in the sky. It took the appearance of a star.  He went inside and got something to drink and he told the cashier about something following him.  He went outside and looked up and it was still there. He got in his car and proceeded to make a right turn on US 127 South.  The craft went from being a star into being some type of ship.  It was within 30 yards from his passenger side window on the right.  It hovered for maybe 10 seconds and slowly proceeded south up the street.  He didn't remember anything until he pulled up at home to park his car.  He had lost 20 minutes somewhere.  The craft went to the western sky and took the appearance of a star again.  He ran inside for a few minutes and then came back out to see if it was still there.  It was and it looked like an orange star.  He got his phone and got about 49 seconds of video.

       "       \"Abduction from a day cab style straight truck. Short (3.5'-4') grey skin tone, (2) to my right side (I was unable to move my head).  At least (1) to my left, as I will explain later. I was laying down in the truck at a Pilot truck stop about 9 miles south of Ashtabula, Ohio. I always cover my windows to keep all lights out and lock all the doors. I had backed in, so the front of my truck was facing the storefront. Typically, I'm out by 11:30 pm, but I kept getting a ringing sound in my right ear and was having trouble with my knee (previous injury, unrelated).  The last thing I remember is starting the truck around 12:30 am to let the heat run.  Then, it seemed almost instantly I'm floating on to a table.  The table felt high up, maybe 5-6'. I couldn't move anything.  My head was turned to my right shoulder.  It felt locked there.  I was overwhelmed with fear and could feel myself attempting to cry out for help.  Two very small 3.5-4' grey skinned creatures were to my right that I could see.  Everyone describes gray aliens different than these guys looked.  Their entire body was stubby their heads were almost too short for their eyes, which were very large like other people describe.  It was more over the shape of their face that look different than typical photos you see.  Where are the photos you typically see show them elongated in the face, these two look like it was almost smush down and like they were squinting with wrinkles between the eyes.  I couldn't speak or cry out, but I started to realize what was going on, so I thought in my head (best way to describe) for them to please help me relax.  I understood what was going on but I could not calm down.  Once I thought that, I could move my arms.  So I reached out towards one with my right arm and it held my hand. I did the same with my left arm and although I couldn't see it something grabbed my left hand.  Their hand was very soft warm but cold, and felt kind of like a toddler's hand feels (smooshy).  Once I was holding with both my hands I could not stop smiling. I was completely relaxed and all I could feel was happiness.  The one holding my hand on the right I believe is the one who was talking to me.  It asked if I was sure that I wanted to remember this time, and I told it I was not sure, but I was unsure of why it said this time.  It was then that I realized that I've been visited several times, I believe th! e first time was when I was five. I recalled a small devil like creature coming through the wall to my room.  I had a bunk bed with no bottom bed, and it just floated straight up to my face.  I immediately screamed, my dad came running in and found me in the far corner by my closet door. Being a kid, I told him the devil came for me. Now that I'm older I realize it wasn't a devil it was one of those creatures.  The next instance wasn't until I was 9 to 10 years old.  As I was going upstairs to bed I stopped at the Landing.  Outside of the window there was a saucer-shaped disc silver in color almost Gray with a large orange Dome on top of it. I thought that I had immediately went downstairs to get my dad.  But when I went to go get him to tell him what happened he asked what I was doing still up.  Apparently I had been upstairs for almost an hour, I thought it was only a matter of seconds. After telling my dad what had happened, he grabbed or old VCR camcorder went upstairs with me, and videotaped this craft which was still hovering outside the window!  After about 10 to 15 seconds, it shot off and was gone.  My dad went downstairs and called Airborne Express, which is the local DHL type company that was in business at the time.  He reported the incident to them as well as Wright-Patt Air Force Base.  No one reported seeing it they said that nothing was showing up on radars around that time and that it was probably a coincidence.  However the next morning when we woke up nothing was on the tape whatsoever.  On top of that we had a large pine tree outside of that window.  It was laying on the ground and completely black on one side like it immediately burnt partially and then died.  There was no other scaring to the ground anything like that. Enough of that back to the present.  So I'm laying on the table and I can feel other hands around me on my legs my arms my ear, and then I feel a hard pressure around my genitals.  Like a pump, but with pain like a heat/pain.  I'm completely distracted while all this is going on though because the creature to my left is now alone it's just me and him with my view.  He's telling me all kinds of things about meeting me in the past, but I can't recall what he was saying. I do recall him saying that I would forget things if I wasn't ready, and unfortunately he had no control over whether or not I would remember.  He could only allow me to remember what I wanted to remember.  About the time that I really calm down and stop feeling like I was going to have a heart attack, everyone was gone.  I woke up in the truck laying on my back on top of my blankets.  The truck was still running, but every light on the dash was lit up and alarms were going off on it, so I shut it off thinking it was overheating.  I turned it back on a couple seconds later and everything was fine.  The whole ordeal did not come to me until after I realize the truck was okay.  I immediately started freaking out, and then I heard the same voice again telling me everything was okay remember what I could he would see me soon. I feel like possibly over the years I have developed a friendship possibly with this creature, but I'm not sure of that.  Honestly I'm not really sure I even believe myself, however I can tell you that those other two instances definitely did occur when I was younger and I always wanted to know why they happened.  I've always had a interest in Aliens, but nothing more than any other young boy does.  I've never fantasized about being abducted I've honestly been freaked out about the thought of it, so I don't think that My Mind is Playing Tricks on Me or that I had a dream.  Another good note to add is I do not think that these creatures had a gender.  The only reason why I say that is the voice in my head that was talking to me did not appear to be male or female. I did wake up with a slight nose-bleed my right nostril, I had a headache and continued to have a headache all day. I had very irregular bowel movements and uncomfortable feeling inside my penis almost like pressure in! ternally. I do not drink alcohol. I do not do drugs. And to the best of my knowledge I have no mental illness from either side of my family that is known. I have never been a sleepwalker, and I don't tend to have very many nightmares. I wish I could remember more of what happened. Although I would definitely be terrified if this occurs again, I hope that I can be more open to it when it does though. I know they will be back because I recall the creature saying it would see me again soon. The beginning of the encounter was very intrusive and it felt embarrassing. They seem to just do what they needed to do, and then they comforted me. I will say that I agree with others about the whole pure love feeling. I definitely felt as though it possibly genuinely cared about me. I'm not entirely sure that it did, but it was a very comforting feeling. One other thing I do recall it asking me was if I remembered them fixing me when I ruined my ability to reproduce. I didn't answer then that I'm aware of but I think I know what they were talking about. When I was on a deployment to Iraq, we would restart the radars standing in range of them. We were warned if we did that we could become sterile. So I used to do it everyday joking that I did not need to have any more kids, as I had already had 3 at the time. I did wake up several nights with nosebleeds in Iraq, but in my opinion I believe at least most of those was due to the desert air. I hope my story has helped and some way shape or form, and I would love anyone can give me any information to help me understand what happened. If I have another encounter I will post it. These are not all of the details of this event I'm not very good at writing out things, and I only wanted to ride out what I was sure of. ((NUFORC Note:  We spoke via telephone with the witness, and he seemed to us to be quite sincere about the dramatic event he describes above.  We are going to attempt to put him in touch with an investigator.  PD))\",\n",
       "       \"Before this event I had epilepsy and was supposed to have it for life.  After this event I no longer had epilepsy.  In the summer of 1975 my family and I had seen UFO'S in Crabbapple, Georgia on our way home from Marietta one evening.  This intrigued us to watch the premier of the movie about the alien abduction of Barney and Betty Hill.   As we were watching the movie, my older brother asked me if I thought UFO's were real and I reminded him about what we saw in Crabapple that one evening, but he asked about the ones in the movie,  I answered if they are real may God send them here tonight and cure me of my epilepsy, which of course upset my mother.  We continued to watch the movie until it went off and the 11 o'clock news came on.   As we were watching the news a bright light suddenly appeared over the back of the house over the end of the patio.  My mother told my sister to turn off the back patio light, but I sat there in wonder because the light wasn't coming from outside the kitchen door and it was to big and bright to be the light on the back of the house.  The moment she told my mother the patio light was off my older brother and I ran to the front door and out of the house.  We immediately looked above the big oak tree and we could see a disc like object above the tree with light beaming behind the tree and house.  There was the sound of the leaves moving like wind blowing on them in the top of the tree but we couldn't feel any breeze at all.  My mother came out after us and she too was trying to make out what this object was above the tree then I looked in the sky over the front pasture and a gray metallic disk about 12-14 ft diameter just like on the movie was hovering in the sky about 15 ft past the fence.  We all looked at it and could even see the alien pilot through a window in the craft.   It hovered there for about 2-3 minutes after we saw it then it speedily sped across the road Hwy 76 and a mountain range.  I looked back at the tree top and that craft was still there with the light on.  I could not see the mother ship; it was attached to until later on after the 3 discs had attached to it and it began to move but I'll get to that later.  After a minute or two after the disc flew South over the road it appeared to fly back from over the ridge two houses East of where I thought it went.  It came back and hovered in the same spot as before and hovered there for about a minute or two then another one came racing from the East on our side of the road and the disc which was hovering in the initial spot shot to the East chasing the other disc and they flew Southwest and out of sight.  A few moments later the another disc came flying back from over the road and ridge and hovered in the same spot as before.  It sat there for over a minute then it eased toward the craft over the tree and attacked itself to a craft I couldn't see.   About a minute later the two discs chasing each other raced back from the East and one of them returned to hover in the initial spot while the other one sho! t back over the road.  It eased over my head and attached to the opposite side of the invisible craft making a triangular pattern with the other two discs.   About a minute after that the last disc came back from across the road and eased above the left above me and attached to the invisible mother ship in line with the discs on the left forming a backwards check. I wondered if another disc was going to come and complete a triangle, but it didn't.  Instead the last disc moved slowly to the East forming a diamond of all 4 discs.   Afterward the ship started easing to the right and there was a reflection of stars rolling across the bottom of it which made me realize that I had been standing directly under the mother ship the whole time.  As it lifted up and to the East, I watched in total amazement because this part wasn't included in the movie.  It rose to about 25-30 ft, and before it shot off, I remember the pyramid or triangular shape in the back but underneath the 4 discs were in a diamond formation.  But before it even moved to take off it turned off the light over the back of the house and I could clearly see the disc on the front bottom of the ship and it too put out a golden light like the other 3 discs.   That weekend my father came home from Marietta.  He watched the same movie and his mother's house.  How we found out was at the dinner table while having supper.  He asked us who moved all of the cattle from the front pasture to the back pasture.  Nobody including our ranch hand had moved the cattle.  So my dad asked us how the cattle got moved Mom and I explained what she, my older brother and I saw until the point her and my older brother came back in the house.  I had to explain what I saw afterwards.  He asked my mother why she didnt make me come back in she said I refused because I thought they were going to heal me from epilepsy.  The next day I went with my dad and ranch hand to look at 3 dead head of cattle.  We lost 2 heifers and a bull to mutilation.  I was sworn to secrecy by my father not to even tell my mother and! siblings about them other than I had to say I saw claw marks like bear marks to support my dad saying the cattle was killed by a bear, but in reality there were not claw marks and the cut marks on the face of one of the heifers was precision.  Our neighbors the ((name deleted)) had some of their cattle mutilated and I broke my silence to a member of their family in my class and my family going to their house for dinner one day our fathers agreed to tell everyone who asked that their cattle were killed by bears.  We were sworn to secrecy because my father did not want us being held on a military base and me and other members being government guinea pigs.  In 2005, I saw a show about UFO's and saw footage of one being chased by a US fighter pilot.  It had 4 discs underneath and reflected the clouds like it has a cloaking device in Star Trek.  The pilot claims he tried to fire on the object but his weapons wouldn't work. You can pass word to him that he isn't alone seeing that craft.  Those! circles underneath it are saucers that detach separately but  are smaller discs than others I've seen, even though they look similar.\",\n",

I've been missing about 5 hours or so, since I left Beach and saw the Billings city limit sign, according not only to the vehicle clock, but also via checking for the local time on a cb radio, got several answers all within a minute or so of the clock in the jeep, so my time perception was fine.

       "       'Huge Triangle shaped craft seen with lights coming on and off, possible lost time, weird anomaly of not talking about it at the time. Female friend and I were standing on her porch in a very rural area near Austin, IN, (between Austin, IN and Crothersville, IN) around 11:00pm in the fall of 1994 in the fall.  We were talking and saying goodbye, and all of a sudden we saw 4-5 white lights come up to the south east.  I originally thought these were helicopters since I saw round white lights shining down and I attempted to make it fit my reference frame, as we have had helicopters looking for pot, etc in that time – the problem was it was night time and there was no way they were really doing that at night.  Also, there were no sounds – I’d never seen a helicopter that made no sound – I thought in my head this must be special military aircraft.   I then was trying to look closely and finally the lights went out.  Then all of a sudden, lights came on the southeast area and the straight east,  shown above the tree line across the road from the house, 5 or more round white lights were shown.  I looked closely, again, trying to understand the context of the lights, they began to change color – purple, green, yellow, white, etc.   She and I never spoke.  Then, the lights shifted, turned white, and shone up and I was able to see that this was a huge craft.  Triangle shape and very large – length and height.  As the lights shined up on the craft, it looked like landscape lighting shining up on a very large building and was above trees at a height over 70 feet I assumed 500 feet long.  As I looked closer, I saw this craft was huge as the lights shown up the sides and showed the huge shape – my frame of reference was the tree line.  After a short minute, the craft moved forward (south) and I could see the triangle shape of the monstrous building size craft more clearly.  Then the lights went out and I could not see the craft any more.   Then small white lights came on and they moved on (about 5-10 of these) and move on south – the triangle craft was gone and only the ligh! ts left – like they quickly shot out of the craft then the cra! ft was g one leaving the lights.  Like the craft disappeared or turned into the small lights.  The lights then blinked out and then disappeared to the south.  I then regained my senses and looked at my friend.  She was still “fixed” on the scene and didn’t respond to me.  I looked at my watch and looked for any missing time, but didn’t at that time detect any.  But, I did notice that it seemed like I had a “bad edit” ( I heard that in a later discussion) because I really was lost for a minute.  My friend and I then went back to talking like nothing happened.  We did not mention it.  I then drove back to my house a few miles away, and checked my watch again looking for any lost time.  I didn’t notice any.  When I got home, I called her and said “Did you see that?”  She then said to me, “Did you see that, too?”  It was so odd that we both ignored it at the time although was very profound, but then noticed the importance later.  As I heard the description of sightings or abductions as “ba! d edits”, this fit that description exactly.  Although I have had other memories, this is the detail I remember in general.  Sorry it took so long to report.  Again, I can’t explain why I haven’t.  I did tell my sister about it the day after it happened and she remembered our conversation.',\n",
       "       'Awoke with triangle marks on my body, twice. 2nd time, felt a pinch in my rib and passed out, awoke with second one in area of pinch. Hello! I recently experienced an extraterrestrial event that was not a UFO, but could have been \"alien\" activity. I was doing research on Malaysia Flight 370 and was piecing things together with a few friends (such as the fact \"they are not human\" was said in the blackbox recording and the plane had simply disappeared). I was extremely tired so I had decided to put my computer down and to go to sleep. I fell asleep and the next morning I woke up and saw a triangle mark on my right thigh.  I sent an image to my friend, she saw it immediately in the photo replying \"what ((two words deleted)) is that, you probably got abducted.\"  That hadn\\'t even crossed my mind.  Then I was thinking about the research me and my friends had done the night before involving the sentence \"they are not human\".  This seemed very stupid to me and I was thinking I had just overthought the situation. A few nights later, I felt a pinch on my rib, and immediately passed out (it happened fast and I had no intention of falling asleep, but woke up the next morning). The area on my rib that felt pinched the night before felt extremely bruised.  I looked at it to notice that it was a triangle mark, and hurt extremely worse than the one on my thigh.  I do not have a picture of this one. Long story short, I woke up with triangle marks on my body,  TWICE.  My orange tabby also kept biting at the marks, which he never bites me.

UFO Sighting 9/18/18  Approx. time of sighting 9:52 P.M. 9:55 P.M  I’m out hunting elk by myself on the Washington State coast.  I’m hunting on Weyerhauser property located along Hwy 101 between the towns of Aberdeen and Raymond.  At the mile marker 69 on highway 101 there is a locked Weyerhauser gate.  The gate is located on the East side of the hwy.  I was driving the gravel roads hunting elk in the vast forest east of highway 101 behind the locked gate at mile marker 69. After an uneventful evening hunt, I decided to go to sleep early.  Once the evening hunt was over and it got dark I decided to look for a place to park my pickup truck with canopy, so I could get to sleep and get up early for the morning hunt.  I’m driving east on Sprucedale Road and I take a left onto a lesser traveled road at mile marker 10.  I drive on the side road for about 2 to 4 miles.  I come to a crest of a small hill and find a small semi flat grassy spot surrounded by taller trees.  Because of the taller trees, most of the view of the night sky was obstructed.  I didn’t check a compass but I believe my truck was facing west, and the rear of the truck was facing east.  It took me a few minutes to view the area and turn my truck around so I could park on a semi flat spot, with my head slightly elevated.  Once I parked, I gathered some stuff to get ready for bed like my cell phone flashlight and pistol.  Once I felt I had everything I needed, I shut off the truck engine and headlights. I exited the truck and walked behind the truck.  I had my back to the back tailgate of my truck and I was facing what I think was East.  I had to pee.  My view as I was standing there peeing was the gravel road as it went down the hill in the opposite direction of the way I traveled in.  Since there were no trees on the road itself.  The road provided a small opening in the sky.  I didn’t see anything unusual at all. I could hear some wrestling in the brush about 30 yards in front of me.  Probably a small animal. I finished my business and I opened the truck canopy and, crawled over the tailgate into the truck bed.  I spent the next maybe 2 minutes or less situating my sleeping bag and getting my shoes off.  I get into my sleeping bag then I notice it.  I left the damn dome light on.  Crap, it's not going off.  I must have left it on when I was gathering stuff for bed.  I get out of bed slip on my shoes open the canopy door and crawl out.  I walk over to the driver door open it and turn off the dome light.  Finally, I can go to bed and get some sleep.  I shut the truck door and turn to go to the rear of the truck. That’s when I see it.  In the small opening in the sky I was just looking at a moment earlier when I was peeing now has a fairly bright slightly reddish color light in the sky.  It seemed the light was perfectly situated in the center of the opening from my perspective.  It seemed kind of shapeless, just light, then at times it looked as if it had a subtle square shape.  Mostly it looked like light and the shape was difficult to see.  No noise. My first though was wow what the heck, that must be Venus, but it seems just a bit too large.  It was much smaller than a full moon for perspective.  I’m looking at this light and it seems to be moving wildly but slowly in a fairly large space in the sky it was maintaining.  Although it looked like it was moving, its general location in the sky was fixed.  I’m thinking is it really moving or is it that twinkle phenomenon that a star or planet gives off to give the illusion that its moving.  I am now trying to figure out if it is moving as well as the distance from me.  As far as the distance from my naked eye it seems like it might be closer than a planet would be.  At some point it looked as if the light was only 100 feet in the air.  I held myself and my head very still and looked at the tree tops and the distance from the tree tops to the light.  When I did this the light appeared to be motionless in the sky.  After I did this I didn’t see any more movement as if it stopped when I really focused on its movement.  This was confusing because it looked like it was really moving.  I walked back to the truck and grabbed my binoculars from the dash.  I looked at the light in my binoculars and I thought wow it seems further away than with the naked eye and a bit crisper, so maybe it is Venus after all I told myself.  I was going back and forth viewing this with binoculars and naked eye, trying to analyze what I was seeing.   Just when I had convinced myself this was Venus, poof it vanished.  It was instantaneous, I was staring at it intently and all of a sudden nothing was there.  Ok that freaked me out a bit, I almost dropped the binoculars.  That is defiantly not Venus or any other planet or star.  It didn’t dawn on me until after it was over, when I was analyzing the light to try and determine if it was a planet.  I forgot that I was just looking at that spot in the sky while I was peeing moments prior and there was nothing there so had I realized that I could have ruled out a planet right away. When it vanished, it didn’t fly off or streak away.  There was no left right up down movement at all.  It was there then it was gone it just disappeared from sight instantly.  There was a weird detail at the very instant it disappeared the night sky in that area seemed to go a shade lighter.  I thought holy crap, that didn’t even look real.  The light change was very subtle but I seen it.  It reminded me of older movies where the eye could pick up the subtle change in the scenery when they cut and splice scenes.  I thought the light change was like a reset or something.  It almost looked fake like a movie but not.  Omg maybe I was abducted and they just dropped me back off. Moments after it vanished, I jumped in the back of the truck bed and grabbed my cell phone and pistol.  I was a little freaked and excited.  I got into the cab started up the truck and drove away. I checked the time to see if unknowingly hours had gone by.  There was no unexplained time loss.  I felt like I was only on the site for about 10 minutes.  I called my wife to tell her what had just happened as soon as I got a block or so from the site.  The call was made at 8:56 pm. I drove back to the gate on highway 101.  I drove down the road to the park and ride about 10 miles north of the gate.  I slept the rest of the night in the back of my truck at the park and ride. The strange light was there in view for 2 or 3 minutes total. Its creepy to think about but If I hadn’t left the dome light on I would never have seen it. I would have just gone to sleep. It seems as if it waited for me to get into bed before it appeared, because it didn’t appear until I got in the truck bed and shut the canopy door, as if it was waiting for me to get in so I wouldn’t see it show up to watch me. The next morning I went back to the exact spot to investigate in the daylight. I seen nothing but forest. I don’t know what it was. I never seen it appear, but I did see it disappear.\",\n",

I was watching and it was just floating there and then the beams from it shut off and it started to fly along beside our boat and I looked away and looked back then it was gone!!

       "       \"There was more than just one witness that seen that UFO that night… .As us kids (6 of us) and Mom had seen it too… I was 4 years old in kindergarten when we had seen it that night… It was one big one with lots of pretty colored moving lights and a turbo or wind tunnel of loud sound...It broke up into 3, all as well with lots of pretty colored moving lights and they were in a triangle formation.... The 2 smaller ships dropped out of sides of bigger ship....   My Mom took pictures as she yelled at us too get into the house,but we were really poor and by the time we got way older and could afford to have film developed, either the film was runt and or too old or lost, we only found alot of black pictures from that time that was probably exposed to light and never came out…   Our Mom told us never to tell anyone when we were growing up so they didn't think we were crazy... It was right above us and huge it had to be only about 50ft up and it stayed for a long-time! ..Mom said she was scared and was afraid it was gonna take one or all of us and she said made us go into house and then it was gone, but in all reality not one if us can remember anything after we seen them....I really wish I could be hypnotized and go back to see if maybe we were abducted and didn't know…   Anyways found this article today, because I have been talking to psychologist about it.....I  Actually had my mom to google UFO's in Vinita back when I was 4 which I was born in 69 which made it 73, we seen it and this made us excited because we really did see what we knew we all seen..  We lived in same vicinity as were the one witness had seen it, just cliser to the Langley/Vinita side..  Thank you again for documenting this and that I ain't crazy, we really did see it....  Thank you again\",\n",

       "       'Lights in the western sky over Auburn, WA, night after night, not normal aircraft. These lights have been appearing nightly for at least two years, beginning at about dark, in the sky either over western Auburn, or slightly farther west. They are not conventional aircraft.  They do not have any red/green running lights, they are much brighter usually, and often they flash brighter, systematically.  They are composed of what appears to be either one, or as many as 3-4, bright white lights.  They hang in the sky for several hours usually, sometimes moving short distances to the left and right (as viewed from east of them, on Lea Hill Road in Auburn), sometimes moving farther to the north. There are normally three or four of these objects which appear at once.  The normal air traffic in the area can be seen passing in front of them, and it seems to ignore their presence.  Sometimes the objects appear to flash red or blue.  They are almost always present for at least 2-3 hours, and sometimes have been present as late as 3 AM. I am a professional UFO author, a witness of at least a half-dozen sightings of alien spacecraft during my life, and an abductee as well.  I am not likely to misidentify conventional craft as a UFO.  I am familiar with most types of military craft, including stealth craft and exotic craft. I do not know what these craft are, but they cannot be conventional aircraft in my opinion due to their configuration of lights, motion in the sky, presence in the same location for so many nights, and the fact that they are clearly brighter than conventional aircraft’s white lights.  They should easily be spotted by radar from Auburn airport, Boeing Field and Seatac. As to the possibility that they could be drones, I tend to doubt that idea.  There is no reason that I can think of for drones to take up the same position in the sky, night after night, for literally years on end, when there is nothing of particular interest happening in or around Auburn that anyone would have reason to go to so much trouble and expense to observe.  They clearly are unconcerned about being seen, and usually just hang in the sky, moving short distances roughly north or south and then returning to where they were initially. Could they be some type of alien craft?  I cannot answer that question, I only know they appear to be distinctly different in appearance to conventional or military aircraft I am familiar with.  Someone surely will be able to identify them, from Seatac or Boeing ATC centers.  Whether they will do so honestly is another question. ((NUFORC Note:  It seems noteworthy that NUFORC has received no other reports about the alleged, nightly sightings.  We will encourage the witness to obtain high-quality photos of the alleged objects.  PD))',\n",

There were all sorts of scalpels, probes, and other equipment.   I saw a creature in a bio-mechanical suit, probably to protect from the unkown.  I was then knocked out and the next thing I knew, I was back where I was abducted but without my dog.  I still to this day can't find him. It was a labratory with intrtumants.  I was lieing on a metalic table with a swing-arm hanging over me.  It was very dark, but I could see a little.  There were snapping and clicking noises coming from the darkness.\",\n",
       "       'I was pulled through the ceiling in Arizona by a tube of windy light when I was 7 years old in 1976. Hello, My name is ((deleted)), and I was abducted when I was 7 years old.  I don\\'t know if it was angels or what, but it was real.  My mom went out for the night and I was home with only my uncle who slept in the other room.  At some point during the night I woke up and was encompased by a tube of swirling light with little flashing sparkling particles moving around me.  I was being carried up through the roof and I was trying to reach for the blowing curtains or anything I could grab to keep me from going.  When I reached the ceiling I blacked out \\'till the next morning.  When I woke up I could tell that something was still there, and I was afraid to open my eyes.  When it walked I could hear static foot steps as they walked.  Then there was nothing.  I finally had enough courage to open my eyes and I saw my mom so I looked around and was amazed.  I have never made my bed. My bed was not made when I went to sleep.  When I looked down, my bed was PERFECTLY made around me.  I asked my mom and uncle if they made my bed around me to cover me up, they said they had not. That is how I know I wasn\\'t dreaming.  That day after, people at our pool and I saw a UFO being chased by 4 black military helecopters.  That is the only recollection I have, but my mom said we were both picked up together another time, and the day after I told her, \"They showed me music.\"  The only thing I can figure is whatever writing they showed me looked like musical notes, because that is what I was learning in school around that time.  This is all true, I would be interested in going under hypnosis to recall more of what had happened.   I am a born again Christian and don\\'t necessarily believe in aliens per say, but I know what happened to me was real, I would like to understand. ((NUFORC Note:  Date is approximate.  PD))',\n",
       "       'Glowing orange teardrop with pulsating red glow on one end. I don’t recall the exact date or time, but it was in 1999, it was cold outside, and late at night. A friend of mine paged me (remember pagers? lol), and I called him back, and he tells me a ufo just flew over his house which was a few miles away from me.  He said it morphed as it went by, and made a strange whirring sound.  I go outside to maybe see if it came my way, and it did.  There’s this orange glowing thing just sitting in the sky. Friends with me fetched some binoculars, and I saw it was almond/teardrop in shape, the entire thing flower orange, no sign of anything metallic, and on the larger end of it was a red, slowly pulsating glow.  It would then move sightly in one direction, turn, and go in the other very slowly.  I watched it for 10-15 minutes until it turned again and flew away in the opposite direction as me. Over time, I’ve seen them here and there, much further away.  I always felt watched, too, but it never felt sinister or malicious to me. It was an incredible experience.  I never heard any sound, though, just my friend who saw it fly over him.  He also said men in black visited his neighbourhood the next day. Also, I had a dream after that night of seeing an alien lying on the ground in what looked like a waiting room.  I sat on a couch, and to my 11 o clock was a hallway that had walls of bright light that led to a dark room.  I look over at the alien, and its eyes open, glowing orange, and I suddenly have a piercing pain in my head. I closed my eyes, and then saw myself sitting on a surgeon’s table in a dark room lit only by the hallway.  Then I woke up.  Makes me wonder if I was abducted.  It still didn’t feel evil to me, though, and I swear my cognition improved the next few days.  It was insane.  I even spotted a small needle-like incision above my left ear which was there for years, but is gone now. ((NUFORC Note:  Source of report indicates that the date of the sighting is approximate.

       "       'Possible abduction in Colorado in 1969 In middle to Late 1969, I was stationed in Aurora CO for tech school shortly after boot camp.  I loved exploring the mountains on weekends, and myself and a couple of AF buddies had rented a motel room somewhere above Boulder.  I remember lying in bed when the room began to go black, and then the stars suddenly appearing, followed by a bright flash of light.  At first I was panic stricken, and I don\\'t remember if the others had seen the light, but I found out that my hair had suddenly grown over an inch in length. When I got back to the barracks the next day, my roommate totally freaked out at the length of my hair.  I was at a loss to explain other than tell him what had happened.  He wasn\\'t sure what to think of my story, but did realize their was glaring physical evidence.   He soon moved into base housing with his wife, and only one of the buddies who were with me remained a friend.  I don\\'t remember if he also went through the same rigorous interogation as I did.  I only remember that he went to Holloman AFB, while I went to McConnell AFB in Kansas.  Many very strange occurred after that which finally ended my military career. I still have trouble remembering many things, as it has always been very \"foggy\" since that time, but I still wonder how my hair could have grown from a half inch to nearly two inches overnight.',\n",

       "       \"October 15th, 2019  Greetings,  I am an Honorably Discharged U.S. Marine Veteran and served during the Vietnam Era... I've always been fascinated about the UFO subject but was very skeptical throughout most of my life until August of 2012 when I experienced an aircraft that flew over my property... I reported it, and to this day, in my mind, I have still not been able to properly process my experience... For weeks I sat outside every night gazing and hoping to have another experience like this one, but I never did.  On November 30th, 2018, I underwent my 3rd shoulder surgery and during the next few months I participated in physical therapy to strengthen my shoulder just as I had done from previous surgeries and I was healing very well.  One morning at the end of February, after a good night's sleep, I woke up with horrible pain in my shoulder. As painful as before my surgery, but I knew that after 3 months of healing and strengthening through physical therapy, I could not have injured it while sleeping, yet the pain was almost unbearable.  I had not taken any pain medication since the third week of December, but this morning I took a prescribed pain reliever to try and overcome the problem... But, I was about to experience something that could not be explained, could not be treated, and could not be reported for fear of the outcome.  When I got out of bed, took a pain reliever and drank a cup of coffee, I headed to the shower.  When I stepped into the shower and started to wash my hair, my whole world seemed to stop for a few seconds.  From the edge of my hairline in the front above my forehead, all the way back to the crown of my head was a very wide and very high scab of dried blood about 3 inches long. This scab was as if I had a deep cut that was 3 or 4 weeks old or more that was never sewn up but left to heal on its own.  The scab of dried blood was hard, wide, and raised about a quarter of an inch.  It itched as if it were an injury that was well into the healing process.  My head was fine when I went to bed the night before, but the morning after I was dealing with something that I could not explain.  I picked at this scab for weeks before I finally got it all cleaned up.  I had no pain in or on my head and no fresh blood. Just this huge scab from a large cut on top of my head that was well into the healing process and now I once again had severe pain in my shoulder.  I called the V.A. Hospital and made an appointment to see the Orthopedic Surgeon who had performed the surgery on my shoulder.  When I attended my appointment he assumed that maybe I just had some inflamation and injected a steroid medication into my shoulder.  I never mentioned what happened to my head as I feared being diagnosed by the V.A. with some mental issue.  A few weeks later I returned with the continued pain, so the Doctor ordered another MRI to see what was wrong.  The MRI verified that the shoulder repair that was performed on November 30th was completely torn apart and in worse condition than before the surgery.  The doctor said the damage looked like I had been hanging by my arm which would have torn apart the tendons that were not completely healed yet...  I explained that I had not done anything that would have caused this and he just shrugged his shoulders... He made me an appointment with an outside surgeon for consideration of a complete shoulder replacement.  Since that time I have undergone my 4th shoulder repair surgery on September 11th.  No complete replacement was done, but a complete reconstructive surgery was performed using bovine collagen patches from a cow to help me grow new tissue... I am currently in physical therapy and hoping to heal up well.  I truly believe that I experienced an abduction that night.  No professional explanation can solidify how the large cut was made on my head and partially healed in the manner that it was, nor the reason that my shoulder repair was completely destroyed as it was.  And, that's not all...  The V.A. has also notified me to inform me that it appears that I may now have prostate cancer.  I am required by the V.A. to have a complete physical every six months and I have had zero symptoms, my PSA has always been normal and I have always had excellent Lab reports.  Until now......  I am scheduled to see a Prostate Cancer Specialist in St. Louis on the 29th of this month for further testing.  I cannot disclose this information regarding my thoughts of abduction to anyone, nor I cannot prove anything...  I just know what I know, and I know that whatever happened to me is not normal, nor is it explainable in a way that would be acceptable other than an abduction.  I just felt like sharing this with you.  Thank you for reading and please keep my identity anonymous.  Kindest regards, -Joe\",\n",

It happend so quickly and it flew across the sky right as I was snapping pictures of the clouds.   I'll attach the picture I took, it's not very good quality though.

I was relaxing in the back of my van on a beautiful rainy evening in Phoenix Arizona.  The day had already been quite weird, such as electronics not working correctly, lots of forgetfulness etc.  Anyhow, I was sitting in the pitch dark enjoying the rainfall when I was moved to turn on my video camera on my phone. I have no idea why I decided to go ahead and just start recording in the dark, but I did.  After about a minute I decided that this was stupid and it was time to go inside my friends home to sleep.  I laid on the couch and decided to watch the video.  What I captured was unbelievable. I recorded a landing of extraterrestrial nature, mind you I did not see this happening while I was recording.  It only showed up in the video. I was stunned at what my camera picked up and began to zoom in and take screenshots of the activity. The more screenshots I took the more in dept! h I saw what had happened. I saw myself walk into the craft as well as these light beings who were performing acts I did not understand. I became obsessed and couldn’t stop going deeper. The next day I became very ill and could barely function. I stayed sick for about a week before I started feeling normal again. A couple weeks down the road I felt strange and I had skipped my period. I had not been intimate with anyone for months but felt the need to get a pregnancy test. So I did and it was positive. I started to freak out because there was no way possible and I had no one to confide in. A few days later I ended up having a miscarriage and was devastated as well as relieved. Since this experience my life has never been the same. I want to share my footage and my story with others because I know I am not the only one who has experienced this.',\n",
       "       '1978 Mountain Home AFB Hybrid-Alien Childhood Encounter This is the shortest version of this report I could possible type and still give an accurate description of what happened to me and several other children on Mountain Home AFB in the summer of 1978. I was only 5 years old when these events happened, but my memory is very strong and probably the reason I am the only person who remembers the encounter. Most of these events were blocked from me until I watched a TV program that showed a book with illustrations of aliens and alien ship types.  When I saw the ship I had been taken aboard, my memories suddenly came back.  I was 13 years old when my memory resurfaced, and I will explain what happen that led to my amnesia of these events until that time. In the summer of 1978, my older sister and I went outside to play.  We lived on Mountain Home AFB in Idaho in family housing just across the field from the Elementary School. The field and the school can still be seen to this day.  My older sister and I had been having odd dreams and even sleep walking. One night my sister was found outside in the middle of the field in pitch darkness having apparently slept walked.  At the same time, I was having nose bleeds that could not be explained.  I believe we were being abducted and programmed for a particular event although I have only one memory of trying to get away from a small odd creature that looked like a little monster in a Catholic nun costume.  So, probably we were taken aboard the ship several times, but I have only been able to recall the one encounter. Well, in the summer of 1978, for some unknown reason my older sister and I were drawn to the large field between the housing and the school on the AFB. Here we joined several! other children all grouped together in pairs of one female and one male. We formed a circle and then backed up keeping out circular formation. An alien spacecraft then suddenly appeared and hovered above us. It had a saucer section at top and then a longer section that dropped down with another small saucer-like section below. The long part was constantly rotating while the top saucer section did not move. There was a beam of blue light and then my sister and I were suddenly aboard the ship in a hallway. I saw something on the wall that looked like a ship with a highlighted area and the word, “The Bridge,” suddenly entered my mind as if the sign spoke to me. In the hallway were two bed that look like the kind found on Ambulances. My sister was on my left and were behind the beds facing a wall and a doorway entrance to another room. To the left of the door was a young female who looked to have very sparse long hair and was dressed in a nurse’s outfit, but probably was only ! 14 to 18 years old. She was taller than both of us, but not as! tall as my mom who is 5’5”. To her left or moving to our right was the opening to the door and sitting on a swivel chair playing with a computer panel of some kind with many switches was a bald male who looked similar to the female. Both had human-like qualities but were not human. To the left of the opening and moving farther to our right were two humans. Both were USAF military and had the American Flag clearly displayed on their uniforms. One seemed to be of very high rank, as he had decoration on his left side pocket. Both were high ranking and apparently were medical doctors. There was a hall to our left and two hallways that broke off to our right with a flat wall with the sign in the center. The female nurse seemed to use Telepathy to communicate. My older sister whispered to me that she had very thin hair. The female nurse became upset and was crying to the other aliens using telepathy that the children thought she was ugly because of here sparse hair. My older sister and I could hear her in our minds too and we immediately consoled her and told her she was beautiful. The two military men were of different sizes. One had brown hair and was short and the other, the higher ranking officer, had blond hair and was much taller. The brown hair man asked us if we knew why we were here. Without thinking, my older sister and I blurred out to play with the children. We said it in unisons. This answer disturbed the brown haired man and he turned to the blond hair man for reassurance. The taller man nodded and the brown hair man said he had to give us a physical before we could play with the children to make sure we did not have measles or any other diseases we could give ! to them. At that moment several tiny aliens entered the room. I could barely reach the doorknob and these aliens were about half my height. They probably were not even two feet tall. I felt their fingers for a few second and suddenly we were all dressed in medical gowns. The doctors were dressed in medical robes and we had patient medical gowns. I hopped on the bed and the brown hair doctor did a quick physical on me while the blond doctor checked my sister. He then slapped me on the leg playfully and said I was healthy and fit to visit the children. At that moment a very large alien entered the room with a huge smile on his face. He was over two meters tall and towered above the tall doctor who was probably more than six feet tall. The alien had a very long neck and big black eyes. He was wearing clothes that matched his skin tone, which was grayish green. He put his arms out and put his arms around the doctors. It was clear this alien was in charge. During all of this, th! e alien-hybrid sitting on the chair watched and kept looking a! t my sis ter and I as if he had never seen human children before and seemed very curious. After the large alien gave his or her approval the smaller aliens grabbed my sister and I by the arms and took us down the hallway to our left. We then entered a different part of the ship were there was a misty like atmosphere or fog. I was then taken to one room and my sister to another someplace further down the hall. In the room was an alien hybrid child about my age with large light blue eyes the same color as my mothers. He did not speak, but used telepathy to communicate with me directly into my mind. He said if we completed our task first, that he would win a prize. I knew this alien child was my brother. We shared the same mother. Our task was to stack wooden blocks with numbers on one side and letters on the other. We had to form a geometric shape, spell out a sentence, and solve a mathematical problem all at the same time. I helped him stack the blocks to form a triangle, spelled out a sentence in English that referred to a cat, and he solved the mathematical problem on the other side. We did it very rapidly and he was very pleased with me and said he would be getting a special prize. The little aliens came back into the room and led me away and redressed me as we walked. Then there was that beam of blue light and I suddenly was on the ground outside the ship looking up with my sister on my side and the children around the ship in the same circular formation. We then all moved to one side of the ship and looked up at the windows of the saucer section. I could see my brother looking out one window and waving to me and I waved back. My older sister was waving at a very tall alien-hybrid boy with brown curtly hair similar to mine. He was probably over seven feet tall, but looked to only be a teenager. There were also several other alien-hybrid children and young adults looking out the window and waving including the nurse at us and the other human children standing next to us. The ship then moved rapidly and stopped for a moment. It hovered for a couple of seconds and then shot off into the sky out of site. When then left the other children and ran home to t! ell our mother what had happened. When we got into the house we discovered our mother was still giving our baby sister a bath in the sink. As long as we had been on the ship she should have been done by then, but she was still washing here as if time had stood still. To this day, my mother, still remembers us talking about the little people and the spaceship, but she thought it was just a game we were playing. My older sister remembers nothing of the alien encounter, but she remembers this next event. The next day, a station wagon with a heavy set brown hair man driving and a curly blond tall woman drove up to my sister and me and asked us if we would like to go for a ride in the new car they just purchased. The man explained it would just be around the block and then back. The car was a station wagon with wooden trim panels and was a big car typical of the 1970s. In the back seat were several children including a boy that was with us the day of the alien encounter. This boy had blond hair and was taller than my sister and probably a little older. All the children were laughing and saying stuff like around the block right and then laughing about it. My sister said we could not get into the car because our mother would not allow us to get into a car with strangers. My sister still remembers the car and the conversation to this day. The man then asked if it would be okay to take a photo of us, and she replied yes. The man looked at the woman and asked her if that would be o! kay, and she nodded yes. He then took a photo of us using a camera with a really bright flash. The next day, I remember hearing a buzzing sound in my head and complaining that I could not remember anything. I knew something was wrong. We moved from Mountain Home AFB soon after and went to another AFB. I did not recall the alien encounter until I watched the TV show some years later and the images of the alien ship, called an Alien-Hybrid Nursery Mother Ship triggered my memories. So, for eight years, I did not remember anything that had happened after the flashing of the camera. Interesting how that ended up in the Men in Black Movies. Everything I have told you is the truth. I have carried this memory for many years now without talking to anyone but my family about it. The US Government says they are now taking UFOs seriously, but have they already known about aliens all along? Unless those two military doctors had their minds wiped too, I would have to say the answer is yes. They not only knew, but actively participated in alien abductions. I have never again had an alien encounter, at least none I can remember. Maybe because I was able to remember they decided to leave me alone, but who really knows? I thought I should post this and let it be known before I forget or something happens to me and my story is lost forever.',\n",
       "       \"odd shaped sighting up real close too in chester NJ going to get videos one night Left my house with best friend, around 9:45 pm, to try to make it, last minute, to the local mom & pop (when these still existed) video rental spot, located in a shopping strip mall type situation in town. Just off the main street through town where all the little antique shops and such are located. Anyway, we left in my 4-runner i had at the time, sunroof open, driving down this real lonely, real empty at this hour, main street, through town, to get to the left turn to go into the strip mall. The only lights on were the sidewalk/street lamps through town, the high pressure sodium variety (orangey). So, as we're coming down this sort of incline into town, we see suspended above the road, I'd say no more than 75-100 feet or less, a darker than the night sky 'shape' with a few lights flashing out of sequence, and not at all in the arrangement any aircraft would flash lights. Some were flashing, strobing, some were pulsing/throbbing. The colors were white, blue! , red and yellow. We stopped the truck directly beneath it as my friend was freaking out (character from Brooklyn, NY) to NOT stop and to keep going on the store. Believer in aliens that her is, lover of Communion, etc tec, he was convinced we'd fall into some abduction...I was having none of it...stopped dead beneath it. Truck and radio running just fine, no electrical disturbances at all. NO sound AT ALL...I mean we could have thrown a rock at it easily, and I wanted to! Though he stopped me from doing just that...it was that close. It was about the same size as a minivan, maybe a bit bigger, it was more or less triangular BUT it featured an odd shape on one side that made it appear lopsided, like an additional lobe if you will, port-side, front was facing to my left. Hovering still we stood beneath it for maybe 7 minutes or so chatting about how strange it was that it made no sound and yet hung above us flashing its lights. Within minutes, something happened that absolut! ely convinced me it was man-made and not necessarily alien as ! it 1.exh ibited NO outlandish physical behavior apart from being quiet and hovering, which for some reason in itself didn't strike me as odd. 2. what really sold us was when it finally did show some life...the 'front' suddenly lit up not unlike the old hideaway headlamps on old american 70s cars? imagine that same idea..so, that seam that runs the complete rectangle that 'hides' the lamps? that lit up and there was a space between the fuselage and lamp 'area' where i could see the still rear facing now LIT UP lamps from under the craft, like a 6 inch gap where i could see inside the headlight area...then they 'flipped open' like a 74 corvette!  lol was so funny and so NOT high tech AT ALL. TWO huge floodlights now shown straight ahead of this vehicle. It then turned slooooowly on its axis..and headed away from us at a pace of maybe 2 miles an hour until it was out of sight..never gained altitude just drifted away over the trees and flashing its lights. I dunno, to me it was totally military...i felt like as we were joking aloud about being watched by the good ole Air force like a sick voyeur would, the lights popp! ed on and it took off real slow. Was cool to see though....something that looked to weigh tons just floating weightlessly right above you for minutes, quiet as a church mouse too.\",\n",
       "       'Multiple ongoing encounters with triangular objects that have un-fathomable speed. Hi I have witnessed craft every night now for 3 months I know that may sound crazy but it very true I am a very sane person to tell the truth I never believed in this stuff. 3 months ago I began noticing starange lights in sky . I started climbing on the roof at night one night I woke up on the roof after falling asleep and all around me was a smoke or cloud like substance that had a weird smell and I looked and not 10 feet from my face to my left was a very very large craft it looked as if it was made from black glass very sleek . I was very shocked that it made no sound. It slowly backed up about 50 yards and very fastly was gone at first I thought it disappeared but it just zipped off well without sound. Since then I have saw other types of craft and also more of the triangles also. The craft are coming progressively closer each night about 2 weeks ago I started seeing another style of craft very close every night I’m not really sure why me why they are n! ear me but every night even when I leave my home I see the triangle ships follow me through my whole trip. I had contacted mufon when all this all began at first the ships used to stay farther out but mufon sent a investigator who was amazed and confirmed the sighting of these craft. Now these craft come substantially closer every single night for the last 3 months these ships always has some type of cloud substance around them I believe they somehow create this stuff because it help conseal  them. Something I might also add ever since contacting mufon I have also been seeing a lot of drones following me which I believe could be government drones I see a very large drone a lot very very close and this drone is a large square platform type drone with a wheel at all four corners and it has multiple cameras the difference in these drones and why I believe they are government is these things are semi loud to extremely loud and all the exterterestial craft is silent. I’m not sur! e of your procedures but I hope they are different because I w! as very disappointed in how my experience with them was very underwhelming. I decided to reach out to ufo center because yesterday I believe I was possibly abducted for the second time, I contacted mufon after the first. I don’t remember but small bits but the whole day is missing for both me and my girlfriend the first abduction I had a small incision on the back on my head and she had something protruding from her ear lobe. This time she had no marks but I have a small incision to my lower left back.',\n",
       "       'Very bright star like figure, near an airplane that was possibly Abducted but this star like fugure So, I am younger than you can say an adult, but I was in my moms car, and I was staring at the sky, then I glance to the left, and a light appears, it was very faint at first, then after a period of around 10 seconds it got brighter and brighter,  Then I screamed to my brother, and said, \"Do you see that light?!\" and I pointed to it, and he saw it. After a period of around 8 seconds, it just sat there, then all of the sudden a second object appears,  But I don\\'t think it was a UFO, it looked somewhat like a plane. It had wings like an airplane, But there was something strange, they weren\\'t moving. and they were in the sky at around 135 degrees South West, and all of the sudden, the second object, which was the one that looked like an airplane, faded away to the direction of the first object and this took around 5 seconds, but which felt very slow, and after these seconds, the 2nd object disappeared and after around 10 seconds, the first object, faded away at the same speed as it got bright.  I would describe the first object as being like a star, like the north star, circular, but I couldn\\'t see the object clearly because of how bright it was, the light was the same as a star, but it couldn\\'t be a star because how early it was and my street is kind of light polluted, so you can\\'t see stars until relatively late at night. I had Always been fascinated by strange things, such as the paranormal.  But I always had this fear of when you read or watch something, or imagine it, it would become real. This terrifies me, because i\\'ve never thought they\\'d be real but they are.  And I know I am not lying, and i\\'m still terrified from this event.  I don\\'t care if you don\\'t believe it\\'s real, but I know it in my heart an mind that I saw this, and something I will never forget. Now I know that we are not alone, and no one can take this knowledge away from my heart, such a terrifying sight it was.  At second thought, I think That airplane may have been abducted, but I am not sure.  I think this may have been a reason for the flights that have disappeared over years. Well that will put an end to description and explanation. If you read this, please note that I am not trying to waste your time, and I seriously believe in what I saw.  Thank you for your time.',\n",
       "       'It was a pale blue circle that flew to the Horizon At a blink of an eye And it had no sound I saw above me around blue object with no sound and it  omitted  no light I had family standing next to me but by the time I pointed to it It had flown south so fast that when I looked to the horizon it just started going over the Horizon and it disappeared the family members that with with me they didn’t have a chance to see it  I hadn’t said much about it but when I seen UFOs lost evidence on TV about two boys in the 70s that were fishing and they were abducted the portrayal of the ship on the TV was what I saw almost exactly if mine was a little different but it was close enough for me',\n",
       "       \"6 floating crafts flashing red and white lights spotted at 5am in Brooklyn on 12/12 This is not the first time I have seen alien craft outside of my window at my home in Brooklyn.  The first time was in October and I swear I almost got abducted. But the one I’m reporting now is from two days ago.  I am of sound mind and completely sober at the time of these events. I am 21 and have been living at this address for just over a year. I was sitting on my couch minding my own business on Youtube at 5am 2 days ago, when I noticed a strange, red flashing light above a neighboring building from the corner of my eye coming from my window to my right side. I disregarded it as a warning for helicopters and planes flying low. However, a couple minutes later I noticed another red flashing light right next to it.  That caused me to get up and look out my window. To my amazement, I saw 6 red lights stuck in the air like light bulbs all flashing in a syncopated manner. There might have been more but I only noticed 6. Five of them were in a line across the ! sky and 1 was above them.  These crafts were 100% not helicopters, planes, or any other flying craft that I am aware of. They stayed stationary in the sky for close to an hour before all dispersing one by one in different directions slowly.  I captured them on video. I snapchatted them to all my friends and no one could explain what they were. They alternated flashing from white to red. However the red light that they illuminated was unable to be captured on my phone. Only the white light that they made was.  And I can't explain how but I'm pretty sure they knew that I was watching them because every single time I left the window after being bored from watching them (because they were literally just boring flashing lights in the sky) and then returned to my window, there would be one flying away.  This all occurred before sunrise early Thursday morning and I saw the last two fly away right before the sunrise.  I have video evidence and I will email it to you.  In the video ! I am filming the crafts from my fire escape on the third floor! of my a partment building.   While we are on the topic of aliens I do want to talk about my encounter in October as well because that was WAY scarier.  This was just one craft and it came directly to my backyard and I was standing feet away from it. I noticed it the same way I noticed these red flying crafts; out of the corner of my eye while I was sitting on my couch. Except this time it was October 15th and 9pm. I heard a fleet of helicopters flying around my house for about an hour. I thought that this was very suspicious but I didn't think much of it. Then, out of my window from the corner of my eye, I noticed what appeared to be a helicopter fly down into my backyard. I ran right to my window because I was like, “What is a helicopter doing flying down into my backyard in brooklyn?”.  When I approached the window I did NOT see a helicopter. I saw a pyramid shaped craft directly in front of my fire escape. Im talking like feet in front of it.  I was absolutely petrified. It was a translucent craft ab! out the size of a small helicopter (think buzzard helicopter in GTA 5 for scale). It spun around in the craziest way possible.  It didn't spin on any particular axis it just spun in every direction imaginable. Maybe it was changing shape, I don’t know. It made a loud droning humming noise similar to a heater which could be heard in addition to the fleet of helicopters (yet I did not see any helicopters anywhere i just heard the fleet of them in addition to the droning of this crazy craft.)  This triangular craft also had the ability to be completely invisible phasing in and out of reality at will.  Most of the time it was translucent but it would switch from being translucent to invisible. Then at one point, it was completely present. When I saw it, the colors of it were almost unearthly. The triangle was this weird whitish/silverish color and this bright red light illuminated from the center of it. But it wasn't red. It was like a billion different reds and oranges at once! .  My primitive guess on the situation was that it was trying ! to signa l to me by showing me light frequencies that are visible to the human eye.  I had a thought to get closer to it and get on my fire escape, but after lifting the window, I was entirely too scared to go through with it. I didnt even lift the screen before slamming the window shut for protection and so I just continued staring at this thing I might never see again in my entire life.  After a good 5-10  minutes of staring at this thing, I decided to rush to get my phone on the couch to capture it on snapchat.  But once again, I felt like this thing knew what I was thinking and doing and in the 10 seconds I went to get my phone, it had gone back to translucent.  It was essentially invisible by the time i tried to take a video of it but you can STILL SORT OF see it in the video that I captured its just quite difficult because it is 90 percent gone. But you can still see the outline of this triangular craft.  I still have this video and look at it constantly.  After I first recorde! d it, the translucent craft floated away and I stared at my 30 second recording on repeat for about 30 minutes still in shock before I sent it out as a snapchat. Most people I sent this video to disregarded it as nonsense but two people responded that they totally saw what I was talking about. This translucent pyramid craft.  This was one of the scariest moments of my life. And unless there is a government in this world that has access to shape shifting, non jet or propeller propulsion crafts that can phase in and out of reality at will, I am certain I saw aliens right in front of my eyes that day.\",\n",
       "       'Orb of light appeared out of thin air, and zipped away at a speed I can’t even comprehend, God’s? Alien Spacecraft?Idk it was beautiful Nobody will believe me, i’ve been seeing double digit numbers all the time like, 11:33, 4:44, 2:22 etc. I thought it was my guardian angels until I kept waking up with marks on my body. I had the roman number 6 (VI) scratches next to my eye on my cheek bone. I had the number 11 scratched on my leg. So I did research and other abducties have had similar experiences. I try telling people this because i’m so confused and I want people to hear me out but they think i’m crazy. My and my best friend had previously saw a glowing orb in the sky that disappeared in seconds on September 25th around 8pm. Me and my coworker saw what we thought was a shooting star on September 27th. But here’s the story i’m deciding to report which happened tonight October 1st, 2019 around 9pm.  So one night I was working as a pizza delivery guy, and as I was trying to find the customers apartment, I kept seeing double digits and I felt like I was being watched, so I just got really angr! y and fed up and I was like “IF IM BEING HAUNTED BY DEMONS OR ALIENS, SHOW YOURSELF SO I CAN KNOW WHATS GOING ON” and two seconds later my intuition told me to look up at the sky and, A orb of bright light was hovering perfectly still above the clouds, as if it were watching me and as I reach for my phone to try and record it, it zipped away at a speed I can’t even comprehend.. and then later reappeared out of thin air. It was beautiful but terrifying. It moved SO fast my soul was stunned. What is it? Craft? Or Interdimensional beings? Gods? Us from the future? I’m not sure what’s going on but should I be worried that the second I asked “Them” to show themselves, I see a UFO watching me literally right after??? If they get me what do I do? This is a global emergency, what are they and why are they here? I intend on finding the truth.'],\n",
