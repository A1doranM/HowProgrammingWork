# Redis Cluster

    - Redis Cluster = Hosting multiple master shards

    - Data is automatically shared across multiple Redis Nodes

    - Automatically splits datasets among multiple nodes

    - Continue operations when a subset of the nodes are experiencing failures

## Redis Cluster Data Sharing

    - Data sharing is based on Key-Hash tags
    - Each master node in a clustr handles a subset of the 16384 hash slots
    - Every node in a Redis Cluster is responsible for a subset of the hash slots

e.g.

    First node takes Hash slots from 0 to 5000, second from 5001 to 11000 end third
    11001 to 16484.

## Setup configuration of 6 nodes cluster

    We have 3 master nodes and 3 slave nodes, 1 for each master.
    
    Slave nodes using as backup for master, if master shutdown the slave promote
    to master. If slave shutdown nothing happens.

Create configuration 

1. Create a directory and config files for six nodes
   
    mkdir cluster

Inside cluster create directory and config file for each node

    mkdir 7001 7002 7003 7004 7005 7006
   
    touch n1_redis.conf
    touch n2_redis.conf
    touch n3_redis.conf
    touch n4_redis.conf
    touch n5_redis.conf
    touch n6_redis.conf
    
Content of the files, remembers to set different port in each file

    port 7001
    cluster-enabled yes
    cluster-config-file nodes.conf
    cluster-node-timeout 5000
    appendonly yes

Then move to each directory and run nodes

    redis-server n[number of the node]_redis.conf &

Create a cluster with some ip and ports of our nodes

    redis-cli --cluster create 127.0.0.1:7001 127.0.0.1:7002 127.0.0.1:7003 127.0.0.1:7004 127.0.0.1:7005  127.0.0.1:7006 --cluster-replicas 1

Lets perform some operations with different nodes of our cluster

    redis-cli -c -p 7001   -  connect to node
    keys *
    
    quit 

    redis-cli -c -p 7003   -  connect to another node

If we put information in some node, regardless to which node we connected, Redis 
automatically calculate hash for our info in distribute it evenly between master
nodes in a cluster. Remember, slave nodes are using only as backup for masters.
