# Redis JSON

RedisJSON is a module that implements a JSON data type for Redis. 

It allows: 

    - storing
    - updating
    - fetching JSON values from Redis keys
    - atomic operations fo all JSON values types
    - fast selection of elements inside documents
    - native JSON data structure in Redis
    - schema free - each document can contain different elements

Full support of the JSON standard

Documents are stored as binary data in a tree structure, allowing fast access
to sub-elements

## Advantages and disadvantages

Without JSON 

To modify s single property in a string, we have to:

    - pull the entire string
    - deserialized it
    - change the desired property
    - re-serialized it
    - store again

With JSON allows us to store a JSON 

    - in a single key
    - regardless of depth and child data types
    - no additional keys of data structure mappings are required
    - we can view or modify JSON objects properties/attributes withour retrieving
        the entire object
    - fast access
    - less network bandwidth used

## Set and Get JSON values

Lets set a JSON key called 'foo' with a 'bar' value

    json.set foo . '{"foo": "bar"}'

    json.get foo

Get type of value in JSON 

    json.type foo .foo   -   string

    json.type foo        -  object

Add new property to existing JSON

    json.set foo .test 1 

    So now it looks like 

    {"foo": "bar", "test": 1}
