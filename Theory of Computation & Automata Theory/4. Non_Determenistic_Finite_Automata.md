#NFA - Non-deterministic Finite Automata

DETERMINISM
    
    >> In DFA in current state we know what the next state will be

    >> It has only one unique next state

    >> It has not choices or randomness

    >> It is simple and easy to design

NON-DETERMINISM

    >> In NFA given the current state there could be multiple next states

    >> The next state may be chosen at random

    >> All the next states may be chosen in parallel

## Formal Definitons

A - could stay in A or go to B

L = { Set of all strings that and with 0 }

Q - Set of all states {A, B},

Sigma - Inputs {0, 1}, 

q0 - Initial state { A }, 

F - Set of final states { B }, 

Delta - transition functions that maps Q x Sigma -> ___ How to calc this??

Answer: 
    A x 0 -> A
    A x 0 -> B
    A x 1 -> A
    B x 0 -> final
    B x 1 -> final

From A we can go to A, B, AB, final

3 states - A, B, C

A -> A, B, C, AB, AC, BC, ABC, final (8 in total)

or 2^3 = 8, so Delta = 2 ^ Q
