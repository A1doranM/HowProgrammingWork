### Communicating using the synchronous Remote procedure invocation pattern

#### Handling partial failure. Circuit breaker pattern

##### Developing robust RPI proxies

Whenever one service synchronously invokes another service, it should protect itself
using the approach described by Netflix

##### Recovering from unavailable service

One option is for a service to simply return an error to its client. For example,
this approach makes sense for the scenario shown in figure 3.2, where the request to
create an Order fails. The only option is for the API gateway to return an error to the
mobile client.

#### Using service discovery

Service instances have dynamically assigned network locations. Moreover, the set of
service instances changes dynamically because of autoscaling, failures, and upgrades.
Consequently, your client code must use a service discovery.

##### APPLYING THE PLATFORM-PROVIDED SERVICE DISCOVERY PATTERNS

Many modern deployment platforms such as
Docker and Kubernetes have a built-in service registry and service discovery mechanism. The deployment platform gives each service a DNS name, a virtual IP (VIP)
address, and a DNS name that resolves to the VIP address. A service client makes a
request to the DNS name/VIP, and the deployment platform automatically routes the
request to one of the available service instances. As a result, service registration, service discovery, and request routing are entirely handled by the deployment platform.

The key benefit of platform-provided service discovery is that all aspects of service discovery are entirely handled by the deployment platform. Neither the services nor the
clients contain any service discovery code. Consequently, the service discovery mechanism is readily available to all services and clients regardless of which language or
framework they’re written in. One drawback of platform-provided service discovery is that it only supports the
discovery of services that have been deployed using the platform. For example, as
mentioned earlier when describing application-level discovery, Kubernetes-based discovery only works for services running on Kubernetes. Despite this limitation, I recommend using platform-provided service discovery whenever possible

### Using Asynchronous messaging pattern

### Creating an API specification for a messaging-based service API

You must also describe the format of the messages using a
standard such as JSON, XML, or Protobuf. But unlike with REST and Open API, there
isn’t a widely adopted standard for documenting the channels and the message types.
Instead, you need to write an informal document.

A service’s asynchronous API consists of operations, invoked by clients, and events,
published by the services. They’re documented in different ways.

#### Documenting asynchronous operations

![img_70.png](img_70.png)

#### Documenting published events

A service can also publish events using a publish/subscribe interaction style. The specification of this style of API consists of the event channel and the types and formats of
the event messages that are published by the service to the channel.
The messages and channels model of messaging is a great abstraction and a good
way to design a service’s asynchronous API. But in order to implement a service you
need to choose a messaging technology and determine how to implement your design
using its capabilities.

### Using message brocker

A messaging-based application typically uses a message broker, an infrastructure service
through which the service communicates. But a broker-based architecture isn’t the
only messaging architecture. You can also use a brokerless-based messaging architecture, in which the services communicate with one another directly.

#### Issues with a message brockers

Using multiple threads and service
instances to concurrently process messages increases the throughput of the application. But the challenge with processing messages concurrently is ensuring that each
message is processed once and in order

![img_75.png](img_75.png)

![img_76.png](img_76.png)

In this example, each Order event message has the orderId as its shard key. Each event
for a particular order is published to the same shard, which is read by a single consumer
instance. As a result, these messages are guaranteed to be processed in order. 

#### Handling duplicate messaging

#### Replicate data

![img_83.png](img_83.png)

One drawback of replication is that it can sometimes
require the replication of large amounts of data, which is inefficient. For example, it
may not be practical for Order Service to maintain a replica of the data owned by
Consumer Service, due to the large number of consumers.

#### Finish processing after returning a response

## Managing Transactions in Microservices

### Using the Saga pattern to maintain data consistency

Sagas are mechanisms to maintain data consistency in a microservice architecture
without having to use distributed transactions. You define a saga for each system command that needs to update data in multiple services. A saga is a sequence of local
transactions. Each local transaction updates data within a single service using the
familiar ACID transaction frameworks and libraries.
