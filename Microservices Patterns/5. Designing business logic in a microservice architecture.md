## Designing business logic using the Domain model pattern

Organize the business logic as an object model consisting of classes that have state
and behavior.

In an object-oriented design, the business logic consists of an object model, a network
of relatively small classes. These classes typically correspond directly to concepts from
the problem domain. In such a design some classes have only either state or behavior,
but many contain both, which is the hallmark of a well-designed class.
