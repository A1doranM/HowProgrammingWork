A better approach is for the API gateway to authenticate a request before forwarding it to the services.

Authenticating a clientâ€™s credentials is important but insufficient. An application
must also implement an authorization mechanism that verifies that the client is
allowed to perform the requested operation. For example, in the FTGO application
the getOrderDetails() query can only be invoked by the consumer who placed the
Order (an example of instance-based security) and a customer service agent who is
helping the consumer
