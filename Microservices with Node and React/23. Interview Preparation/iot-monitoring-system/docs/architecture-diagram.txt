IoT Monitoring System Architecture Diagram

This file serves as a placeholder for the architecture diagram.

The architecture consists of the following components:

1. Infrastructure Components
   - PostgreSQL Database
   - Redis Cache/Pub-Sub
   - Kafka Message Broker

2. Microservices
   - IoT Simulator (generates simulated sensor data)
   - Data Ingestion Service (processes and stores data)
   - API Gateway (routes client requests)
   - WebSocket Service (real-time updates)

3. Client Applications
   - Web Dashboard
   - Potential Mobile App (future)

Data Flow:
- IoT devices produce data to Kafka
- Data Ingestion Service consumes from Kafka and stores in PostgreSQL/Redis
- WebSocket Service consumes from Redis and broadcasts to clients
- API Gateway routes HTTP requests to appropriate services
- Clients connect to WebSocket for real-time updates and make API calls through API Gateway

Note: A visual diagram can be generated from the mermaid code in architecture.md
